hwzip is Hans Wennborg's zip tool that supports the pre-deflate compression methods commonly found in ZIP archives before 1992.
The info-zip tools (unzip, zip, etc.) found on Linux do not support these methods, so hwzip is required for extracting old archives.
The C built tool is in the public domain and is kept in this repository for contingency purposes.
