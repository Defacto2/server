#### **THG F/X**

THG F/X was started around three months ago. I, Sauron, had wanted to start a group that would specialize in VGA loaders/demos. So far, the group has done pretty well.

#### **The current roster for THG F/X is:**

- **Sauron** - President/Main Coder
- **Nimbus** - Vice Prez and in charge of P/R
- **Tornado** - Artist
- **Maverick** - Artist
- **Excessive Freddie** - Coder
- **BananaZor** - Coder
- **Peeping Tom** - Coder

The current project for us is this magazine. Since we have had numerous people wanting to join, we have decided to test a few of them. If you would like to help code VGA loaders, VGA intros, or VGA menus, let me know. Also, we need more ANSI artists and someone who can make digitized sound and music.

On another note, we are looking for more BBS or group affiliations. If you are interested, we may consider linking together. We always want new ideas, so we will be open to them in the future.

#### **Razor 1911**

Razor 1911 was formed back in 1985 on the Commodore 64 and since then has thrived on many computers and in many formats. Recently, they have made their presence known in the IBM world and are slowly growing their way to the top.

Kigger, Razor's WHQ, said the group's official comment is "No Comment." They seem to concentrate on the bigger releases.

Dracul, the president of the group, thinks their group's future looks bright and looks forward to a Razor/USA world. The general feeling for them are that they have a card up its sleeve ready to be pulled just in time for the Christmas rush.

---

#### **National Elite Underground Alliance**

NEUA seems to be surviving a few minor ed/ware releases lately. Many, many repeat releases. Nothing big to speak of, and it doesn’t look like many major releases will come from these guys this Christmas.

---

#### **United Software Association**

The big question mark. Although the not-so-humble Babe and Genisis is starting strong, rumors of financial mis-drifts are hurting them. Also, a good percentage of their releases have been un-cracked, causing many hardliners to react negatively.

The newcomers seem to be much more forgiving, but even some of the kiddies/lames/shamers are starting to object. The upcoming months almost seem to determine their future. Will they need to work hard as hell to make sure they don’t let Razor plant their feet even deeper into the ground?

#### Illiterate Pirates?

They come creeping up when we aren’t watching... Always lurking in innocent hard drives... Never giving up... Fighting chance-striking with unmerciful blows... Screams of anguish and pain are heard as you extract them...

The ZIP File from Hell!
That’s right. Many of us have experienced this form of torture. Just never realized it. What? You have no idea of what I am talking about? Let me explain...

It is a sunny Saturday. The birds are chirping, the squirrels are squirreling, and the air is fresh. Unfortunately, you are suffering from the party the night before. You stagger over to your computer and notice that a brand-new ZIP file has been uploaded to your favorite BBS. "Hmmm..." you say, and type away at your keyboard to get this file. You wait and wait. More than 10 minutes later, it is done. You check the monitor, and the screen finally pulsates on.

'Hmm... 7 new files..' So, of course, you are curious as to how "The Mongrel Idiot from Pluto" plays. Unknowingly, you exit to DOS, type the usual "unzip" command line, eyes half-open, relaxed at that. You are all serene and confident when suddenly...

Wait... What’s that? A "Read Me" file? No! Nooo! A full screen message? What?

"Potatoes, Megzi man! Warez R Kool!"

At this point, you don’t need any more confusion. You quickly scan downward. Another line!

"Registered? Where that be from?"

You understand little, but still endure that form of hell, proceeding to a place where there is... There is... No unzipping! Rather, a mere tally of files that don’t exist!

Instead of authenticating their creativity, someone has merely renamed 7 other ZIP files and merged them into one, where you discover nothing but garbage.

A sigh of death from those who have been through this torment... An agonizing pause. You begin to ask yourself, "What profits a painter to waste a brush devoid of all paint?"

And just in time to play "The Mongrel Idiot from Pluto," suddenly you realize you have 20 minutes or so... If nothing else, you have acquired a new "7 files" ZIP set.

This unexplainable horror... In the 50K BBS ad!! **The End!!!**

Here is the transcribed and properly cased text from the image:

Non-animated!!! You are now lying on the floor, gasping for your last breath... Struggling for the energy to rise to life... With an energy remaining in your body, it is the only task manageable. You run different BBS files, searching for a chance to wake up... And finally, hits the run-all three BBS-ads at it, watching the animation slump down cruel and evil...

Watch this, and you will be crueler... Your enemies ineffective... And soon, it is over.

Lots of names on the ANSI: Giz, HST, Speedz.

And the first selection... Accelerated this Swahili message... Makes your head explode... So the file gets zipped, and on... Waiting people in its path, never letting up for even a minute.

So the moral of the story is: Control yourself! Nothing is more infuriating than ads, and as such, it would be wise to make hate a little harder than before. Just think... Think anyone cares that their version of an ad comes with new fonts, animation, and nonsensical minutemates, and finally loads? Then the names should not be in those loaders...

With this in mind, here is a ladder from the group that released.

The game. But when 5 BBS’s choke it with their VGA ad, it can get fucking annoying! If you have a nice loader, put it on your board, or upload it to other boards. That way, people will download it at their leisure, and it’s bound to get around. But if you put it in every ZIP that comes out after your board, people will automatically see the name and delete it.

I have even reduced some ZIPs by 40K after stripping loaders. No big deal if you put a 1K or 2K loader. That’s 320K a week! So, SVGA? Next time, think again. You don’t want boards to kill it! It could mean the death of your board or other ZIP file hell-makers. But I think I got my point across...

As for replacing “SS” with a “Z”? Well, look at the title.

### Sauron’s VGA Loader Class 101

This is the moment most of you coders have been waiting for. I have included a file called **SAURON.ZIP**, which contains source code and examples on coding VGA loaders. In this file, the **SAURON.NFO** has a list of variables on this issue’s lesson. In this issue, I have covered how to display a 320x200x256 picture, fade routines, and palette cycling.

I hope this helps some of you out, and in the next issue, I am going to cover scrollers.

### The ANSI Pages

_A Bi-Weekly Analysis of the ANSI Scene_  
**Reporting this issue: Canseco**

OK, let's see if it's possible to report on the massive activity in the ANSI world for the month of November. This month, we got a sneak look at two guys who look to have bright futures: _Khan_ and _Hatebreeder_ make me feel, although the feel has been around for a while, like ANSI is somehow starting off all over again. Their work is clean and shows a sharp edge that is quite refreshing. Both have font styles with a dark feeling.

This month, we have _Raven_ with bad karma again at full peak! He is creating monster-like-looking font work that will make your monitor beg for mercy. The man shows no signs of slowing down!

The old ANSI group merges are still happening, with _Twilight_ being the strongest out of all of them.

This month has finally determined which group kicks it, and it’s _F/X_! The men behind this soap opera have kept themselves together and seem to be stronger than ever.

The biggest news since the ANSI standard: ICE the merges with ACiD. A ton of ICE's old members are given the boot, ACiD improves its VGA section and wipes out virtually all competition overnight. One problem: the people who make ANSI to begin with. Several are now out of it completely, and will we ever get the kind of ANSI we used to? Not at this point, but as you are reading this, expect the future! Right now, the _KFA_ artists setting into ACiD is what they had in mind to finally perfect a standard where we know what we’re getting. And the plan? Knows where he is! Here is the elegance plan.

This is currently being called a _sorta_ fan club for ACiD. ACiD did not organize a whole fan club system based on top.

- **ACiD** - The best in ANSI/VGA
- **SDA** - One step down from ACiD
- **FISH?** - Below SDA
- **HH ANSI** - The start

Now, you’re gonna need to find the bottom 10 groups. But other than that, your set. Everyone has a specific rank. Class groups will hold up their reputation, and everyone knows his place in the scene. Look for the _KFA_ pack in the future. They are an excellent second platform for what will be a lower group section for credit reference and have one senior staffer who stays with that group. That guy can recommend promotions, recruit from the lower groups, etc. We hope you ANSI dudes can figure something like this out among yourselves and can thereby support the BBS world better. _The Humble Review_ will be happy to print whatever you plan on doing, as well as any charts you feel could explain the situation.

### Porn vs. Piracy

While many magazines devote their entire rags to blasting newcomers to the pirate world, _The Humble Review_ is taking a different approach to this subject.

Lately, there has been a new kind of war taking place, a war which a few new BBSes have taken into their own hands. This war is not about software, nor is it about politics—it is about _pornography_.

The simple fact is that tomorrow may be nesting on a foundation of BBSes that don’t call for file messages on each and every download. Since many pirates are getting into "hacking" porn to the extent of GIFs, animations, and "XXX-rated" pictures, unfortunately, unless something is done about it, the pirate world will never be the same.

Porn-based BBSes offer little more than the same thing every other board has—one little "XXX" and what is this? Simple PD porn BBS? Let’s not fool ourselves here, the average pirate is 14, with a severe case of acne. Which would you want more—a feed to a board with a billion GIFs, more than you know what country you’ll be wife material for (without looking at sight), or a board on which man, breakthrough after a year in jail, will have even had trouble finding a SysOp who would submit to be one of your friends in good standing?

Look at one of the ever-popular _XXX_ GIF smut shows. I spoke to one who believed me on this issue and asked him if he thought of what he must see every time he started up his collection. His first reaction after a slight thought was, “No, not to be wise.” His first reaction had been known to be wise, as a pirate must learn to be broken now.

Look at it this way—if the FBI ever gets “one of them,” chances are that pirate world will have some converse and fall apart. Hard to know where, as the topic could be straight arrows where how names too should be. Stay tuned for part two of this series in an upcoming _Humble Review_!

### The Other Guys

**By Canseco**

The way things are going, by this time next year, _The Humble Guys_ will be just another group with a few releases that could not hold out. And who knows, maybe a little competition for them would actually be fun.

Believe it or not, a toast that still has heart is _Knockers_. Good crackin’ experience and not only that, but he does not have to use IM users (who we kicked out under marketing agreements, to be honest). If anyone wants to be a _THG_ rival, they have to do it on their own. And so far, they have succeeded.

In order to win, they have put up an elite BBS, have people who know how to crack and survive, and most importantly, they have maintained their own identity. That is why _Knockers_ has been doing so well, and will always be a well-favored supplier to those who look for quality instead of just a couple of files to toss on a board.

The _THG_ movie show (which will be released in a couple of weeks) will highlight the fun.

One thing is for sure—when a group is nonsense, and starts to lose big games, and turns into an info supplier just to keep themselves in the charts, they have lost. Knockers, a medium-sized game group, maintains respect as a competitor for the crown.

THG-The big question mark. They will either fly or die.

### Letter from the Head of Writers

_The Humble Review_ is looking for more writers and more fresh ideas! We count on you guys to keep us abreast of your part of the pirate world. When we lag, it's also your fault!

This issue we're bringing to you after finally here after a _4-month galactic issue_—at least more of you will contain this. We talk of the possibility of another mag coming in here, a _THG_ release feature panel, and other ideas. If you want to see _THG_ in a more personal form, although talks at this time are discreet, we want to hear your source for news and where _THG_ is moving. You want to see _THG_ in a new way? Then send in all your talks at this time, and I'll type them in next issue!

In the next issue, we plan on having a _WANT AD SECTION!_ Whether it's users, new _BBS_ connections, or something like a _SWAPPER_ ad, it'll be featured with good leads and links to find new people.

But for the next issue, we need content! With more editors and features, I'll continue for now, and more regular features will print from _THG_. If you feel that contacting the group is freezing over lately, group changes might be forming.

Either way, I am waiting for your messages, so get writing!

_Galactic Review - The Staff for the Galactic Review was_

Fusty, Slasher, Air Jordan, Mr. Cool Dude.  
I'll let the others tell you about their help.

Hopefully, you all will enjoy this mag and pick up Issue #2, where we really start rocking!

**The Humble Review - Interview with The Byter**

When the Eel and I were talking about the possibility of a new pirate magazine, _The Humble Review_, we decided it had to be totally fresh and original. Start a tradition of it's own. Yet share the great heritage of the earlier magazines. In this interview you'll will hear from somebody who by himself, has helped to shape the pirate world, yet also pays respect to the founders. The magazine was delayed for this interview, but we think it's well worth it! Ladies and gents here is The Byter interview, as done by Mr. Cool Dude.

Interviewer : Mr. Cool Dude
Ideas/Suggestions : Canseco/The Eel
Place/Date of Interview : 11/22/93-Lexicon of Cabal

### Introduction

This is the interview with The Byter, the maker of the famous Celerity, Celeritynet, The Lexicon CAE, and the 2750 MEG Lexicon of Cabel. Byter is one of the all time best known pirates around, who started back in the Apple days. Let's get started with the interview.

**The Apple Days**

> #### Could you tell us about the Apple days vs. IBM days and what’s the biggest change?

The Apple days were.... Well, that can be a loaded question, because for me, the Apple days date back to 1981 or so, and a lot of changes have occurred. The early Apple days were mostly simple message systems and occasional transfer systems—100k disks with DOS 3.2 storage on the average. A few files were floating around, but it wasn't really 'piracy' yet. The real modern form of cracking appeared with the introduction of the Apple 1200bps modem, which was around 1980. This is where 'elite' Apple BBSes came online. It was a glorious time.

There wasn't anything which was cracking groups yet. Everything which was cracked was credited solely to individuals.

Later, during what I would call the 'IIgs days,' the pirate community was a lot more organized. Crack groups started to form steadily, and speed cracks were starting to come into fashion. Even in 1985 or so, you would see games that had been out for a couple of months before everything was finally pirated.

In the current world, things are very different from the Apple II days. The names are much more well-known, the methods are much more unique, and the standardization of file formats and the actual information that runs software are evolving faster. This is for the better, but it isn't always quite the same for the mentality of systems. Because the messages are not indivdual to the particular board. Other reasons include the courier system, which gets all the new files to all the boards, and the fact that a relatively huge number of users are in fact SYSOPs. Back in the Apple days, the ratio between users and SYSOPs was far greater than now; I'd be surprised if the ratio was greater than 10:1.

As for cracking groups, they've changed as well. Apple's cracking groups (when they weren't simply individuals) were usually either one member or an initiator with a few affiliates helping. Nowadays, groups tend to have more than five members. This is because they are the "team" of BBSes, which support them no matter what. There often would be suppliers who never see the rest of the group, but supply their own titles in their own way.

The ideal group would seem to be forming now, where it is a logical extension of the SYSOP. I am, of course, speaking of the tendency to have 10MB groups—the SYSOPs, suppliers, and other assorted baggage.

**BBS Programs**

> #### What made you want to write your own BBS program, the famous Celerity?

Well, initially, I didn't. I had written a BBS program (before KaliCom for the Apple) from scratch and definitely did not want to take on a project of that scope again. When I set up the Lexicon IBM/Amiga, I wanted a system that would provide a good piece of software with a unique approach and the best in both IBM and Amiga users. Hopefully, one that didn't cater to just one market, but still maintained a decent piece between the IBM and Amiga users. I had chosen to use the other generic programs, such as TBBS or whatever, and found them to be, in hindsight, an inferior approach, which looked pretty but lacked a unified system. The concept I wanted to use was to provide separate networking from networking, so that I could have different program people talking on different levels, while still keeping it from being "another bulletin board."

Now, to design a feature was one thing, however, to build a unique BBS program is a lot of work. I didn't want to write a program, I wanted something that would serve my needs accurately and well. I figured, well, someone is bound to come up with the thing I wanted soon. Take it easy. Knowing that such a project would take at least 4 months at the minimum, I hacked up the framework in a month or two, and more people expressed interest in running it and the rest history.

> #### Do you think it's the right of BBS programmers to put backdoors in their BBS programs?

Good question. I think it is the right of a programmer to build in anything that he or she wishes. Stupid and immature, I think that if a programmer does so without making references to it or making a show of it, then it's no different than a trojan. One should definitely know and understand and run the risk of making the modifications that exist. We base our policy that users must have a background (basic to working experience at least) before running and learning to use software. However, it also should be noted that if a trojan or backdoor exists in a BBS program, it is still an invasion and greatly helps authors in securing their systems, but does not help for its reputation. In short, a trojan is illegal, even if the victim did not like the results.

> #### Back to Celebrity. How did people respond to Celebrity when you first announced it?

It never really was released, so to speak. Most people turned their noses at it because it wasn't seen to be a free system, and a monarch to users began to get the feeling of being ripped. But most of the pirate community expressed of hostility for it. With the development of Interest, two of my users, Bubba Magilicutty and Cool Fusion, showed some interest in my software, and so I gave copies to them. In return, they took my software and wrote a "trainer" for it. Since the software might make note of something, both Bubba and the Fishworld hacks were run in conjunction as he began working on it. Soon after, he released the modifications that were in the same manner as with the established software.

> #### What is special about the PlusNet on Lexicon and how does a sysop get into this net?

PlusNet is our attempt at interlacing the old network conference in telephony of the '70s so users in three areas can read messages at the same time, much like normal BBS software. It is to be considered a "public" area for private subs (such as the Apple II) to function in. As of yet, the system has been built but remains inoperative. We have not used it to its full extent at this time. The net has been inactive for more than four months, and it was rather a supplement for BBS systems rather than a replacement.

> #### What do you think of PCs (post call ratio)?

I am a strong supporter of them. I feel that transfers alone are a very poor indicator of a user's quality, and a post call ratio gives a much more detailed evaluation of a user's interest in BBS use. If a user has a low call ratio, it can be presumed that the user calls only to transfer and does not wish to participate in much of anything else. If a user has a high call ratio, it would be more significant to talk to the user about asking them to go elsewhere for their transfers. I feel that the best indication of a user’s quality would be their overall maintenance of a good post/call ratio, even maintaining the average PCR throughout their many visits. This is quite important to an overall system, much as a ratio is when on a carped monitoring but networked subs, and none of the users communicate of the networks and elsewhere.

**The Alternative**

> #### What is the idea of "The Alternative"? Is there any main goal for this group?

The Alternative was an idea creation about two years ago, roughly in the present day within the pirate groups, as an assistant system. My idea had essentially the same idea and derived from the Lexicon reference. The Alternative does not so much compete with existing pirate groups but rather to complement them, The Alternative would release docs, solves, fixes, cheats, and occasional valuable utilities, including modem programs, versions of GEM, Sozicon, and even the ELF utilities. One of the first releases from The Alternative was Lexicon, and from that time on, it released something under the Alternative's name, but it was never meant to be a contender with the big boys.

**SCD's Warez Report**

> #### Could you tell us about the Warez Report that you do monthly for SCD?

The Warez Report initially began because I was a member of SCD's group and I had seen some of the releases and the confusion as to just who released what. (To each his own, I guess.) However, I felt there needed to be some order to it. It started in 1990 and has continued to grow because it attempts to keep a listing of who did what, when, and what was modified or removed. It also sets up a standard in the groups as well, something that was much needed at the time. Hopefully, it will continue to evolve and hold as some standard for the groups to live up to.

**The Future!**

> #### What do you think could happen in the future to make the pirate world better then it already is?

All kinds of things! Seriously, I think that the users, sysops and groups could all make things better by simply being more responsible. Cracking groups could put more effort into ensuring that their releases work the first time, emphasizing quality over speed. And they could also ensure that they produce documentation that is readable. There is also more responsibility in following ethical standards of the warez world—for example, avoiding destructive behavior (crashing other boards, Trojan horses, and spreading harmful viruses).

Another way is to support the pirate community by working with boards and groups to help keep quality high and most importantly by contributing to it. There are always lots of people who want to be involved, but not as many who contribute. If there were more of a network, it would be easier to counter bad members, complex release situations, and to make it a more responsible participation. In the board message bases, contributing good information about releases and cracking groups, and how they operate, helps a lot.

Another way to make things better is by keeping a better intercommunication relation among nations and between warez interests, expressing regulations and considerations that would help not only users but those concerned with involvement. There should be a foundation of mailing lists and netmail for users when their rights have been violated. The policy "Everyone for himself" is a very poor policy to subscribe to.

> #### Do you think pirating will disappear in the future (do you think CD-ROM could be a factor)?

Doubtful. Ten years ago, warez averaged 22K. Now, they average 900K each. As the warez grow in size so do our technology.

> editor: note the remainder of the answer was not transcribed accurately by ChatGPT and due to its old hardware subject matter, I didn't feel it was worth the time to manually transcribe it.

### Letter from Insane Unknown

So, here I am, on a prematurely cold and snowy Chicago night, sitting in front of my CBM 8452 terminal, listening to the soothing tones of Pink Floyd with a bottle of Hennessy next to me (waiting to be finished, like Hemingway). All I need is some other elite writer who was often seen with a bottle by his side.

I have been asked to write a short article for the premiere issue of _The Humble Review_. What a humbling experience. I felt my qualifications were more than adequate (you should know and cherish your friends, even though you've never met them in person).

So I’ve spent the last week asking myself: why did they ask me to this? Is it because of my good spelling? (After all, I won a third grade spelling bee), but I ran into a solid steel wall, and could not find an answer. After that I spent another week looking for something to write about, but again that ol' bloody stell wall smashed me in the face again.

I thought of writing about politics, but the 'reverend' Alan Sharpton or the 'Wiz' David Dude would not grant me an interview (neither would Microsoft's William Gates after I told him what the Humble Review was about). Technical matters are oout of the question - 99% of you know 99% more than I do.

Sex? I am writing a book on it but have 10,000 pages left to complete. Eliteness? Everyone tells me 'I am more elite than you', so that is out. I am still without a subject (or a complement, a verb, or even a noun!)

I tried to look back at my college years to figure what had worked in English class. I remember the teacher stressing the phrase _"Focus on your audience."_ Like many unfortunate, select green (when I mean work on my monochrome monitor).

That’s why I try to imagine what you might see if you look at this in a girlfriend’s house. What if someone’s looking back at a color monitor to read this? It would almost be part of the _"1982 Jackson Rainbow Coalition."_

I try to imagine who I am writing to. The first image that comes to mind is that of a retired, destroyed biker with a pocket protector on a leather vest, that was set afire at a punk concert years before when last wearing it. Then there is a 6-foot-2-inch, 270-pound giant with the baddest reputation tattooed on him for years. One of my homely mentors noticed such a thing and when I asked him, he told me it does not stand for _"The Harley Guy."_

So since this is the premier issue, I can claim this was just an introduction. I'll be looking for your suggestions on what to write about, and maybe you will even tell me a little about yourself.

Remember that I know my audience. The letter carrier can leave a private E-mail. I’d love to hear what you think. If you don’t download these mags, don’t fret. I can be found on any system that carries THG's OOFnet.

**Cheers, mates,**
