### Introduction

The games scene is one of the hardest to succeed in. Few groups have managed, some that come to my mind are Razor 1911, Reflux, Hybrid, and Prestige. These groups have succeeded where other groups haven’t, namely Napalm. Unfortunately the FBI decided to do its job. It raided prominent boards and members in the scene. The group to take it the hardest was Prestige, they lost their leader, Zion. As well as this they lost many members to the forming of Class. I spoke to a member of Prestige who will remain anonymous and he said yes they are! Prestige was a great group who ruled 1996. It was unfortunate to see them go unexpectedly. But things get better and better, and out of Prestige came the group known as Class. This group has many great members and has already shown itself as a force to be reckoned with, with releases like C&C Gold. Unfortunately they will never reach their full potential as members Shadow Master and cyberwreak were forced to retire. Other groups think Class may succeed but it is still to early to tell as new groups goes under rather easily. Although Class has good leaders and good members from Hybrid, Razor, and especially Prestige.

Reflux has been ruling the games scene so far in ‘97 with about 18 releases. Reflux was one of the only groups not badly affected by Operation Cyber Strike. In fact the co-leader tells me that Reflux was helped by OCS. In his words:

> “Really, the only thing that happened to us was our WWG got shut down b/c the sysop grew tired of running it. In fact, OCS (Operation Cyber Strike) HELPED us. We now have several new security policies on our sites and BBS to help prevent federal intrusions.”

Many people regard Reflux as the budget releasers, this in fact is not true. All groups release crap and budgety titles when no other titles are available, but in times where releases are coming thick and fast the majority of groups only release quality games.

Although Razor 1911 was also hurt by the forming of Class and OCS they have come back to the scene in ‘97 with leall releases. Razor has always been the group with the most quality and prestige in their games, I have never known a game of Razors to be not working properly, best C&C: Red Alert. Although I am not sure whether to call all their releases quality... Razor 1911 will be a hard group to beat and even harder to kill, expect to see them rocking the scene in the near future.

Hybrid are a respected group in the scene. They have been around since Feb ‘93 and have earned themselves a respectable name in the scene since then, with releases like the much acclaimed Diablo. Hybrid have been rather quiet during the last month or so. Hybrid like the other groups forming was hurt by the forming of Class. They lost their Danish division which included Dogfriend, Drake, and Animal.

Class finally is commonly reformed to as the reformed Prestige. During their time Prestige released many games, some unworking. According to some people they “shed the reputation that they inherited, they decided to form CLASS.” The majority of people would agree with that although Class has some great new members. Does the name Class mean anything to the group. According to a member, yes. It means Class will only release 100% cracked games. Lets hope they live up to this pledge. Although Class is only new they have already risen up the scale to a ‘classy’ group.

On a final note, as the interviews show, Operation Cyber Strike helped the scene by showing them to be more careful, but the people I interviewed do not wish to see the scene disappear underground again.
