**The Humble Review - Interview with The Byter**

When the Eel and I were talking about the possibility of a new pirate magazine, _The Humble Review_, we decided it had to be totally fresh and original. Start a tradition of it's own. Yet share the great heritage of the earlier magazines. In this interview you'll will hear from somebody who by himself, has helped to shape the pirate world, yet also pays respect to the founders. The magazine was delayed for this interview, but we think it's well worth it! Ladies and gents here is The Byter interview, as done by Mr. Cool Dude.

Interviewer : Mr. Cool Dude
Ideas/Suggestions : Canseco/The Eel
Place/Date of Interview : 11/22/93-Lexicon of Cabal

### Introduction

This is the interview with The Byter, the maker of the famous Celerity, Celeritynet, The Lexicon CAE, and the 2750 MEG Lexicon of Cabel. Byter is one of the all time best known pirates around, who started back in the Apple days. Let's get started with the interview.

**The Apple Days**

> #### Could you tell us about the Apple days vs. IBM days and what’s the biggest change?

The Apple days were.... Well, that can be a loaded question, because for me, the Apple days date back to 1981 or so, and a lot of changes have occurred. The early Apple days were mostly simple message systems and occasional transfer systems—100k disks with DOS 3.2 storage on the average. A few files were floating around, but it wasn't really 'piracy' yet. The real modern form of cracking appeared with the introduction of the Apple 1200bps modem, which was around 1980. This is where 'elite' Apple BBSes came online. It was a glorious time.

There wasn't anything which was cracking groups yet. Everything which was cracked was credited solely to individuals.

Later, during what I would call the 'IIgs days,' the pirate community was a lot more organized. Crack groups started to form steadily, and speed cracks were starting to come into fashion. Even in 1985 or so, you would see games that had been out for a couple of months before everything was finally pirated.

In the current world, things are very different from the Apple II days. The names are much more well-known, the methods are much more unique, and the standardization of file formats and the actual information that runs software are evolving faster. This is for the better, but it isn't always quite the same for the mentality of systems. Because the messages are not indivdual to the particular board. Other reasons include the courier system, which gets all the new files to all the boards, and the fact that a relatively huge number of users are in fact SYSOPs. Back in the Apple days, the ratio between users and SYSOPs was far greater than now; I'd be surprised if the ratio was greater than 10:1.

As for cracking groups, they've changed as well. Apple's cracking groups (when they weren't simply individuals) were usually either one member or an initiator with a few affiliates helping. Nowadays, groups tend to have more than five members. This is because they are the "team" of BBSes, which support them no matter what. There often would be suppliers who never see the rest of the group, but supply their own titles in their own way.

The ideal group would seem to be forming now, where it is a logical extension of the SYSOP. I am, of course, speaking of the tendency to have 10MB groups—the SYSOPs, suppliers, and other assorted baggage.

**BBS Programs**

> #### What made you want to write your own BBS program, the famous Celerity?

Well, initially, I didn't. I had written a BBS program (before KaliCom for the Apple) from scratch and definitely did not want to take on a project of that scope again. When I set up the Lexicon IBM/Amiga, I wanted a system that would provide a good piece of software with a unique approach and the best in both IBM and Amiga users. Hopefully, one that didn't cater to just one market, but still maintained a decent piece between the IBM and Amiga users. I had chosen to use the other generic programs, such as TBBS or whatever, and found them to be, in hindsight, an inferior approach, which looked pretty but lacked a unified system. The concept I wanted to use was to provide separate networking from networking, so that I could have different program people talking on different levels, while still keeping it from being "another bulletin board."

Now, to design a feature was one thing, however, to build a unique BBS program is a lot of work. I didn't want to write a program, I wanted something that would serve my needs accurately and well. I figured, well, someone is bound to come up with the thing I wanted soon. Take it easy. Knowing that such a project would take at least 4 months at the minimum, I hacked up the framework in a month or two, and more people expressed interest in running it and the rest history.

> #### Do you think it's the right of BBS programmers to put backdoors in their BBS programs?

Good question. I think it is the right of a programmer to build in anything that he or she wishes. Stupid and immature, I think that if a programmer does so without making references to it or making a show of it, then it's no different than a trojan. One should definitely know and understand and run the risk of making the modifications that exist. We base our policy that users must have a background (basic to working experience at least) before running and learning to use software. However, it also should be noted that if a trojan or backdoor exists in a BBS program, it is still an invasion and greatly helps authors in securing their systems, but does not help for its reputation. In short, a trojan is illegal, even if the victim did not like the results.

> #### Back to Celebrity. How did people respond to Celebrity when you first announced it?

It never really was released, so to speak. Most people turned their noses at it because it wasn't seen to be a free system, and a monarch to users began to get the feeling of being ripped. But most of the pirate community expressed of hostility for it. With the development of Interest, two of my users, Bubba Magilicutty and Cool Fusion, showed some interest in my software, and so I gave copies to them. In return, they took my software and wrote a "trainer" for it. Since the software might make note of something, both Bubba and the Fishworld hacks were run in conjunction as he began working on it. Soon after, he released the modifications that were in the same manner as with the established software.

> #### What is special about the PlusNet on Lexicon and how does a sysop get into this net?

PlusNet is our attempt at interlacing the old network conference in telephony of the '70s so users in three areas can read messages at the same time, much like normal BBS software. It is to be considered a "public" area for private subs (such as the Apple II) to function in. As of yet, the system has been built but remains inoperative. We have not used it to its full extent at this time. The net has been inactive for more than four months, and it was rather a supplement for BBS systems rather than a replacement.

> #### What do you think of PCs (post call ratio)?

I am a strong supporter of them. I feel that transfers alone are a very poor indicator of a user's quality, and a post call ratio gives a much more detailed evaluation of a user's interest in BBS use. If a user has a low call ratio, it can be presumed that the user calls only to transfer and does not wish to participate in much of anything else. If a user has a high call ratio, it would be more significant to talk to the user about asking them to go elsewhere for their transfers. I feel that the best indication of a user’s quality would be their overall maintenance of a good post/call ratio, even maintaining the average PCR throughout their many visits. This is quite important to an overall system, much as a ratio is when on a carped monitoring but networked subs, and none of the users communicate of the networks and elsewhere.

**The Alternative**

> #### What is the idea of "The Alternative"? Is there any main goal for this group?

The Alternative was an idea creation about two years ago, roughly in the present day within the pirate groups, as an assistant system. My idea had essentially the same idea and derived from the Lexicon reference. The Alternative does not so much compete with existing pirate groups but rather to complement them, The Alternative would release docs, solves, fixes, cheats, and occasional valuable utilities, including modem programs, versions of GEM, Sozicon, and even the ELF utilities. One of the first releases from The Alternative was Lexicon, and from that time on, it released something under the Alternative's name, but it was never meant to be a contender with the big boys.

**SCD's Warez Report**

> #### Could you tell us about the Warez Report that you do monthly for SCD?

The Warez Report initially began because I was a member of SCD's group and I had seen some of the releases and the confusion as to just who released what. (To each his own, I guess.) However, I felt there needed to be some order to it. It started in 1990 and has continued to grow because it attempts to keep a listing of who did what, when, and what was modified or removed. It also sets up a standard in the groups as well, something that was much needed at the time. Hopefully, it will continue to evolve and hold as some standard for the groups to live up to.

**The Future!**

> #### What do you think could happen in the future to make the pirate world better then it already is?

All kinds of things! Seriously, I think that the users, sysops and groups could all make things better by simply being more responsible. Cracking groups could put more effort into ensuring that their releases work the first time, emphasizing quality over speed. And they could also ensure that they produce documentation that is readable. There is also more responsibility in following ethical standards of the warez world—for example, avoiding destructive behavior (crashing other boards, Trojan horses, and spreading harmful viruses).

Another way is to support the pirate community by working with boards and groups to help keep quality high and most importantly by contributing to it. There are always lots of people who want to be involved, but not as many who contribute. If there were more of a network, it would be easier to counter bad members, complex release situations, and to make it a more responsible participation. In the board message bases, contributing good information about releases and cracking groups, and how they operate, helps a lot.

Another way to make things better is by keeping a better intercommunication relation among nations and between warez interests, expressing regulations and considerations that would help not only users but those concerned with involvement. There should be a foundation of mailing lists and netmail for users when their rights have been violated. The policy "Everyone for himself" is a very poor policy to subscribe to.

> #### Do you think pirating will disappear in the future (do you think CD-ROM could be a factor)?

Doubtful. Ten years ago, warez averaged 22K. Now, they average 900K each. As the warez grow in size so do our technology.
