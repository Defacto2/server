**Pirates Analyze Warez** or PAW was a game review magazine that ran from 1992 to 1994.

In the first issue from November 1992 they wrote, "According to our current plans, P.A.W. will be published twice monthly and will attempt to review each and every game released by any group since the previous issue."

Usefully, they include a list of games included with the group and release date as well as a list of unreviewed releases such as fakes or broken games.

The issues were edited by [Newton P. Forgery](https://demozoo.org/sceners/113030/) of [Mercury Couriering](https://demozoo.org/groups/113031/).
