**PHOENIX** or PHX, led by the famed cracker [HAL9000](/p/hal9000) (HAL) was a PC trainer and game cheat group, cofound by Black Dog in October 1990 on the Quebec based board [The Dirty Boulevard](https://demozoo.org/bbs/5953/). The group expanded slowly and remained focused on the +514 area code despite their use of English games.

By years end, there were half-a-dozen boards, including [Cloak -N- Dagger](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3476/) in New York. And in January 1991, famed cracker [Dr. Detergent](/p/dr-detergent) of [Interceptor](/g/interceptor) joined the group before leaving for [INC](/g/international-network-of-crackers) in April.

He [wrote](/f/ab200b8), "1st of all I'd like to let you know that I've joined Phoenix. The reasons vary, but the bottom line is that I want to be in a EXPANDING group..." The April textfile for [Street Rod 2](/f/ab225aa) contains "HELP WANTED: Dr.Detergent (one of our cheat maker) have left PHX and join INC so we short of people now". Dr. Detergent would return to Phoenix in February 1992, and retire from the scene not long after.

Phoenix was most active in 1990, 1991 and by 1992 had shrunk both in membership and activity.

Known members were: HAL9000, Black Dog, Dr. Detergent, Surak, Grimm, Normulator, Rumble Fish, Symetric Shadow, Mechanical Mennace, Stalker, High Speed, Iceman.
