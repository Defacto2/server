GOTHiC was announced in the November 1993 [iCEPACK](/f/af1adeb) which it stated that five of their Canadian members had left to form a new group.

The new collective managed to release five curated art packs, the first being for November 1993, and the last was for March 1994. Afterwards, the group merged with [ACiD Productions](/g/acid-productions).
