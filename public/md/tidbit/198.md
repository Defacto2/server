[Issue #2](/f/a4466) from late November includes ACiD News, and the rumor mill mentions that Fairlight started (ED: an unknown) new hack/phreak group led by [Axiom Codex](https://demozoo.org/sceners/112958/).

[Issue #4](/f/a5a2b) from January 1993 has a review of the "APX" Apocalypse BBS software. 

[Issue #5](/f/a771a) is delayed and suffers from that annoying ALL CAPS article syndrome. It has an article about the artgroup [Valiant](https://demozoo.org/groups/131797/), formed by ex Legacy members on 20th of April 1993. And another article about the fall of Legacy.

[Issue #6](/f/aa66d) from June has an interview with [Midnight Sorrow](https://demozoo.org/sceners/120104/) of the board [Infinite Darkness](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1504/) and a couple of reviews of Vision-X and Vision/2 BBS software. This issue introduces a number of game reviews for consoles.

[Issue #7](/f/a25eb) article "The Scene" has The Sniper complain about the lack of new cracktros that he calls "VGA/SB"[^1], and suggests many elite PC sceners have moved onto the Amiga and console Scenes. [Kid Capri](https://demozoo.org/sceners/79239/) writes of the history of the artgroups [Masters Of The Art Experience](https://demozoo.org/groups/76670/) and [Mirage](https://demozoo.org/groups/45887/). There is an anonymous article about the ANSI artgroup [Nemesis](https://demozoo.org/groups/90619/).

[Issue #8](/f/a3547) from August 1993 has [Fusion](https://demozoo.org/sceners/17792/) writing about the history of ACiD's [ToXiC NeT](https://demozoo.org/groups/147564/). Also written are articles about the BBS software Weapon-X, the artgroup [TRiBE](https://demozoo.org/groups/43814/).

Issues #9, #10, and #11 do not emulate correctly due to buggy audio drivers in the magazine.

[^1]: The term "VGA/SB" is a reference to the VGA graphic and Sound Blaster audio hardware cards, which were popular in the early 1990s for PC gaming.
