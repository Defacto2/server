The first Sorcerers release, "[First intro](/f/ad3093)" from April 1989 came out in the same month as the "[Lombard RAC Rally](/f/b83fd7)" cracktro Future Brain Inc, a production we currently credit as the first PC cracktro. Was this a coincidence or were the Sorcerers or the Future Brain Inc inspired by the other group and decide to make their own?
