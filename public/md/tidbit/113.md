**Eagle Soft Incorporated** were a very famous cracking group on the Commodore 64, originally hailing from Canada and founded in 1982, extremely early in the BBS Scene days.

The **ESI** brand "EagleSoft Inc" operated as a [courier group](/f/ad42d2) on the PC in 1996 and releases utilities with [Reflex](/g/reflex) in 1997. But it seems likely that the PC iteration was an unauthorized tribute of the group from the Commodore.
