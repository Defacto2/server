We know nothing of the Imperial Warlords other than its May 1985 affiliation with the cracker [Spartacus](/p/spartacus). He would continue to crack in 1986 but would never again mention Imperial Warlords, so it is not known if this was an actual group or an abandoned brand created by him. However the Spy Hunter release claims it is the fourth release.

Two boards are advertised by Imperial Warlords, The Roman Forum (+415 San Francisco Bay Area) and The Kingdom of Chaos (+612, Minnesota). The Roman Forum would continued to be advertised by  Spartacus in his later releases. While in 1986 and 1987 The Kingdom of Chaos would be advertised by the group [Five O](/p/five-o).

The Imperial Warlords release of Spy Hunter includes an unusual text mode loader. While looking like ANSI artwork, it isn’t as the loader uses the computer’s inbuilt text graphics to draw the graphics rather than a series of ANSI escape codes.
