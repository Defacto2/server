The Duplicators are another unknown PC group that possibly were a pair of crackers, given the plural in the name. Unfortunately the original packaged releases are lost but the (c) 1984 in use next to the hacked graffiti in all three known releases give a reliable enough date. All three of these games could have been released as unpackaged binaries and shared on the bulletin boards as-is. They are single file applications and this could explain The Duplicators desire to hack the in-game copyright notices.
