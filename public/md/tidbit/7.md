The Duplicators are another unknown PC group that could be a pair of crackers, given the plural in the name. Unfortunately the original releases are lost, but the **(c) 1984** in use by the hacked graffiti in all three releases and the file last modifications of the binaries offer a reliable enough date. These games were probably released unpackaged and shared on bulletin boards as loose `.COM` files[^1]. They are single file applications[^2] and this could explain The Duplicators desire to hack their name into the title copyright notices.
