**The Duplicators** are another unknown PC group that could be a pair of crackers, given the plural in the name. 
Unfortunately the original releases are lost, however, the **(c) 1984** hacked graffiti found in the releases and the file last modifications of the binaries offer a _good enough_ date. 
These games could have been released unpackaged and shared on bulletin boards as loose `FILENAME.COM` files. 
They are single file applications [^2] and this could explain The Duplicators desire to hack their name into the binaries and the title copyright notices.

The first, popular PC archive and compression utility, [ARC](https://www.pcjs.org/blog/2023/03/07/), (Archive utility by System Enhancement Associates) wasn't [released](/compression) until March 1985. 
Earlier compressing utilities, such as the pair of tools named SQUEEZE/UNSQUEEZE, could not preserve the last modification dates.
So, the dates we use were probably set by the operating system after the game was downloaded from a bulletin board or copied to floppy disk.
