Quartex were a famous cracking group on the Commodore Amiga and consoles.

The [documents](/f/a5193b6) from December 1989 we have for Populous were typed by The Jester from the U.K. and could have been intended for the Amiga release. 

The group releasing as **Quartex PC** from at least February 1992, with boards in [Toronto](https://demozoo.org/bbs/63/), [Australia](https://demozoo.org/bbs/4063/), [Germany](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3177/), and [England](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1720/). However, by November the [`QUARTEX.NFO`](/f/b22388a) would list both Amiga and PC boards in the texts. After 1992 we are not certain if there were more PC releases but the brand did live on, even after the end of the Commodore Amiga. A brief return for a June 1995 PC release showed just two boards from England and the Netherlands, before regular releases continued in 1997.

In 1997 Quartex once had the email, `QTXPC@HOTMAIL.COM`.
