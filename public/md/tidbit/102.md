Start of the Art Software or SOTA was a cracking group from 1989. It seemed to have four members, the leader Cinderella Man, two crackers, SuperConductor and The Analog Kid[^1], and ANSI artist Tom Sawyer.

[^1]: It is unknown if The Analog Kid is the same as the [Analog Kid](/p/analog-kid) from Chicago who was the system operator of [Twenty One Twelve](https://demozoo.org/bbs/4211/).
