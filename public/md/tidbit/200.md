December 1988 saw the first of many mergers for game release groups on the PC with the agreement between the Boys from Company C and Five-O to co-release under the combined name “BCC / Five-O”. [Announced](/f/b24cff) publicly on New Years Day 1989, it seemed the goal was to expand the distribution of their releases to more boards, “as we are just starting and granted our reputation, we hope to establish some GOOD distribution sites for our releases”.

Sometimes the group would be listed as "BCC/5-0" and the members included, Osgood Slaughter, The Maestro, Bilbo Baggins, Clyde Ferndox, Commander 
Zanna Martin, Wrench, Top Gun, Dark Angel, Mr. Camaro, Kloey Detect, Xpax, Merlin Magician.

Before the end of the month, the collaborated name would be dropped as the group Pirates R Us would also join, and the three together became known as **The Firm**. A new name and group who would often dominate the remainder of 1989. The [`INFOFIRM`](/f/ac23918) textfile from the 25th of January for the release of Star Wars had the following, "Call These Boards For More FiRM (formerly BCC/FIVE-O/Pirates 'R' Us)"
