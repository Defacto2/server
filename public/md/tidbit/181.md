MicroPirates Inc. or MPI Magazine was a PC publication, plus it was also a hacking and phreaking group based in New York City. The group had both PC and Commodore 64 sections, plus the occasional member who used an Amiga.

The magazine offered a limited piracy section, usually involving short cracking walkthroughs. However, there is a list of extension acronyms or in that era "makronyms", instead of the less useful lookup tools seen in other magazines of the time.
