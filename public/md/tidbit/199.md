On the 1st of November 1989 it was announced that the groups PTL Club, SPRINT, The UnderGround Council, and the Byte Bandits had merged to become TRIAD. [Jenetic Bytemare](/p/jenetic-bytemare) [wrote of this](/f/a72925), "but seriously, we have merged with several other groups and formed TRIAD, we are composed of members of The PTL Club, $PRINT, UGC, and other groups. Also with our group, are members from the [Emulex](https://demozoo.org/bbs/tagged/emulex-bbs/) development team, [Sam Brown](/p/sam-brown), etc.".

However, there seemed to have been some personality clashes as described by Warlord in a [long text](/f/bb2fcbe) from early December in which he wrote, "Third to let the pirates know that Triad is not exactly ship shape and so on." and goes on to complain about Jenetic Bytemare and other members.

In March 1990, Jenetic Bytemare turns up in [International Network of Crackers](/g/international-network-of-crackers) with the release of [Battle Chess v2](/f/a9229aa). Where he states, "Pardon the simple text file but me and my merry band of krackers have moved over to join INC. That is me, [Null Set](/p/null-set), [Bit Manipulator](/p/bit-manipulator) and Island Hacker."
