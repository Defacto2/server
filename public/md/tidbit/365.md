**How to Crack** is a long tutorial series by +ORC aka The Old Red Hacker.

"The best way to learn cracking (i.e. understanding, broadly individuating, locating exactly and eliminating or suspending or deferring one or more protection schemes inside a software application you do not possess the source code of) is to begin your tampering experiments using OLDER applications which have OLDER protection schemes."

All three downloads are the same series of tutorials, but in different packages.
