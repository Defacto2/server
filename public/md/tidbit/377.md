**UltraTech** went public in 1990; however, it is claimed that the collaboration existed in private for a number of years prior. Captain Tom wrote in [The Pirate World 4](/f/a55ed) (September 1990):
> ULTRA TECH, is a group consisting of the most expertise resources from the technical hardware and programming field. Our members are from a variety of backgrounds. Ranging from running large corporations, to programming for major companies, to freelancers who just have a nak for being the best at what they do. At first I have heard alot of booing "OH No another Group". Wrong, ULTRA TECH, has been in existence for a number of years. We have just decided to go public, so to speak. Anyways for more info on the group, or to participate, call any ULTRA TECH BBS. You will find our boards to be outstanding, for example, ULTRA TECH BBS (which is our HeadQuarter) is running with over 9 GiGs online. Just an example of what to expect from our boards.

The article later sees Captain Tom greeting, "Starwolf - Sysop, [Ultra Tech BBS](https://demozoo.org/bbs/10153/), Ultra Tech PreZ."
[Ultra Tech BBS](https://demozoo.org/groups/75375/) was in Indiana, while the other early boards included, [Twin Peaks](https://demozoo.org/bbs/5036/) in New Jersey, [The Slave Den](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1473/) in Florida, and [Botnay Bay](https://demozoo.org/bbs/10153/) in New Hampshire.

Oddly, a second article by Captain Tom was published six months later in [Cosmic Press](/f/ae1deb4), which contradicts some of what he previously wrote. In "Ultra Tech - The Ultimate Group", he writes that the group was founded, "Over a year ago, starwolf, the Lord and Founder of Ultra Tech, had an idea to form the most unique, elite pirate group". He goes on to say that Starwolf was a system operator of the BBS Botnay Bay, along with Kahn, and together they were the founding members.

The group expanded to bring on boards such as [The Wall](https://demozoo.org/bbs/5026/), [The Final Frontier](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3453/), [LakeSide Park](https://demozoo.org/bbs/4684/), and Grey Stone. However, for some unstaded reason, Kahn and Botnay Bay left the group on good terms. At the time of writing in March 1991, the group had transformed into a BBS corporation with over 25 member "elite" boards that shared a networked mail hub, exchanging over 100 messages per day.  Outside of North America, there were also member boards in Norway, Australia, and Germany.
