**The Alternative** was a game documentation and application release group from 1989 and 1990 that centered around [The Lexicon](https://demozoo.org/bbs/6248/) (of the Cabal) BBS run by [The Byter](/p/the-byter) (TB) out of California. 

In the release of The Dark Heart of Uukrul, The Byter [writes](/f/b021cde), "The Alternative is a special pirate group.  We do not release games like the other groups do, but provide pirates with much-needed utilities and application software, such as Windows 3, WordStar 6..." "The Alternative is meant to be a compliment to the other groups. We often release docs and solves when the other groups do not"

The Byter was also the programmer and author of the popular **[Celerity BBS system](https://demozoo.org/bbs/tagged/celerity-bbs/)** and occasionally [cross-advertise](/f/a922d0e#:~:text=Now a plug for Celerity, the BBS of the future). "Most importantly, The Alternative is the creative force behind Celerity - the most original and advanced pirate BBS being used today."
