**Legend** is another confusing group to follow. However, the name **Legend PC** originated from a July 1993 [release](/f/ac2b9d4) of The Amazon Train, led by The Unknown from Texas and composed of former [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911) members who were once part of the [International Network of Crackers](/g/international-network-of-crackers). In August, The Unknown would be called out in a [release](/g/the-dream-team) by The Dream Team, _Fuckings must go to all ex-Legend: The Unknown as done his best to try and make TDT look bad. Will not happen anymore._

The second iteration from around the same time would see the Danish cracker [Fletch](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=1878) from the Commodore 64 [group](https://csdb.dk/group/?id=176) using the brand for his game hacks. In a [release](/f/ab20310) from September 1993, he'd mentioned he had only been using the PC platform for four months. By early 1994, Fetch would be joined by his fellow Commodore 64 Sceners, [Doc](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=8052) of Denmark and [Dave](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=5443) of Switzerland, plus an unknown by the name of Jay Supreme, releasing games under **PC/Legend**.

The third variant of Legend is the more well-known, being formed by former members of Razor 1911 and [TRSI](/g/tristar-ampersand-red-sector-inc), and founded by Butcher from Texas and [Westbam](https://csdb.dk/scener/?id=2010) from Germany. Westbam was definitely part of Legend from the Commodore 64, but it was said Butcher was too, possibly under a different alias. And soon after, both Doc and Fletch would return, later collaborating as "Fletch & Doc. This iteration dominated their era, especially with the European-published games. However, it was said that Butcher or possibly his board Agents of Fortune was busted, and so the group agreed to team-up with [**Pentagram**](/g/pentagram) to become [**Genesis**](/g/genesis).

An [interview](/f/a214a) by MindBender with Tazman would confirm the different iterations.<br>
M: Who came up with the name Legend? 
I know it was formed once before by The Unknown and other Razor 1911 members but that time it merged [The Dream Team](/g/the-dream-team) and disappeared, who brought it up this time?<br>
T: Westbam and Butcher used to be in the old C64 Legend so it came from there.<br>
M: It had nothing to do with The Unknown ?<br>
T: Nope

To confuse things, this Butcher/Westbam Legend used the same text files and artwork from the two previous iterations, both by The Unknown and the second group with Jay Supreme. And there were several art groups on PC who named themselves [Legend](https://16colo.rs/group/legend), as well as an unrelated cracking [group](https://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?id=358) on the Commodore Amiga.
