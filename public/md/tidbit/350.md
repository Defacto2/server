**Monthly Console Scene Charts International** "And The Fabulous Retroscan!" is a charts magazine with commentary on the top groups of the console Scene. The issue we have reviews the releases of both April 1996 and an April 1995 retrospective. The issue is listed as number 5 and is very thorough and each group is reviewed by Zigor[^2], fAZWONGA\![^3], and Son Doobie.

There is interesting commentary on the current state of the console Scene from the sysop of the [Freek World](https://demozoo.org/bbs/193/) BBS, Faz!. "It's hard to believe at this time how the scene came to a point like this. I don't know how many BBS were slammed down[^1] the last weeks and months, but I guess there were a lot.In the times of 1993 and 1994 was the big Boom in the consoles (especially the Japanese Scene boomed!) 1995 was also cool, and now in 1996...Well,it's nearly dead"
