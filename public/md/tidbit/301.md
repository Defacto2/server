**Stellar 7** were a PC and console group that released game reviews, trainers and cheats. 

They also published **The Console Mag**, edited by [Sub Zero](https://demozoo.org/sceners/49682/) and [Salamander](https://demozoo.org/sceners/49683/).

"This magazine is based on the console scene strictly and console game releases by our favorite pirate groups. It is produced by the Stellar 7 crew, meaning it is structured, organized and written by most of our console division writters. This is our debut issue for October. It includes some great Reviews on the latest games released last month". "Also included in the mag are an article on the history of console RPGs, and a monthly top ten console groups."
