Quasar Magazine was a BBS and pirate magazine for Canada.

We only have issue #2 released in April 1991. Its title scene reads, "The Quasar, Bringing you the New BBS Updates". Unlike many magazines of the era, it seems the text was first prepared on paper, checked and fixed, before being typed in by hand.

The issue contains adverts for ten +416 (Toronto) boards and ten game reviews with screenshots and was a rather large download for the time.
