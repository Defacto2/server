**BAD** was probably a BBS association or an elite user group from 1990, and could have stood for **BBS's Against Dweebs**[^4]. The early tag-lines used in the ads created by [Aces of Ansi Art](/g/aces-of-ansi-art) and [Classic Vocs](/g/classic-vocs) often stated, "The User Group of The 90's".

The [National BBS List #8](/f/ad21096) mentions some drama with [The SysOp Association Network](/g/the-sysops-association-network), as does the [Pirate World #2](/f/ac6fb) that describes it as a “sysop group war”.

Listed presidents were, Mak-Attack, [Shadow Demon](/p/shadow-demon), Nikedemus. The vice-presidents were, Professor Charles X, [Fenris Wolf](/p/fenris-wolf). Some of the boards were [Hamburger Heavan](https://demozoo.org/bbs/5641/)[^1], and [Funny Farm](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7647/)[^2] from New York, [Ozone](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3685/) from Detroit. [Destination Earthstar](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7711/)[^3] ads also had BAD branding.

BAD is often confused with, but is unrelated to the Virginia based [BaD cracker group](/g/bad-ass-dudes) from the same year.
