There is nothing known about SCB other than the mention by Ranger Rick in the 1984 unprotect document for a version of dBase.

Ranger Rick and Rick Ranger was likely the same person who later ran the [The Rockin' Ranch](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7713/) BBS in New York State during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
