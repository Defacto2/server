**International Network of Crackers** was formed in September 1989 by the merger of the New York Crackers, ECA (currently unknown but maybe _Elite Crackers Association_), and the Miami Cracking Machine. NYC would leave a few months later after disagreements on the structure with the new group leaving MCM as the direct ancestor of INC.

Optical Illusion wrote about the group founding in September 1989 in the now-lost INC Newsletter #1, that fortunately was reprinted in [Toxic Shock](/f/ae23ed4). In it, he notes that himself and Line Noise, president of MCM were discussing having an ECA supplier join MCM. From that conversation the idea of a merger with ECA formed, and from which Line Noise suggested bringing the New York Crackers in for a three way tie up. The two phoned The Zenabyte, president of ECA and sysop of [The Dark Domain](https://demozoo.org/bbs/9789/), who immediately agreed to the idea. While JT, president of NYC, confirmed the following day.

The name was decided on a conference phone call with the three presidents. Initial rejected names included, Epic, Mutiny, Link, INT, and CD-13. It was The Zenabyte who came up with **INC**.

The original senior staff were: Line Noise, Optical Illusion, The Realm Keeper, JT, The Zenabyte.
