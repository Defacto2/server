INC was formed in September 1989 by the merger of the New York Crackers, ECA (currently unknown but maybe _Elite Crackers Association_), and the Miami Cracking Machine. NYC would leave a few months later after disagreements on the structure with the new group leaving MCM as the direct ancestor of INC.
