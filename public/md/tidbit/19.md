The UnderGround Council or UGC was a game cracking group from 1989 who become one of the founding members of TRIAD who were credited with releasing some significant titles for that year. [Mack Bolan](https://demozoo.org/sceners/131112/) from New York was the group's president.

An August 1989 [BBS ad](/f/ae4609) lists 11 boards and it is assumed all system operators were members of the UGC.
