Big Brother was probably a cracker rather than a small group. Unfortunately, this crack is complicated to date despite the loader stating the year of 1984. **Sierra Championship Boxing** had a number of reprints on PC in a short timespan, and a number of cracked releases. Online there have been [doubts](https://datadrivengamer.blogspot.com/2023/04/game-368-sierra-championship-boxing.html) over the 1984 publication of the game. However, it was definitely reviewed in [InfoWorld](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=wS4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA38&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) and [PC Mag](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=-Ukz6hjZEA4C&pg=PA311&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) in 1984.

From what I can determine,

- The [first print](https://www.sierrachest.com/index.php?a=games&id=362&title=championship-boxing&fld=box&pid=3) of the game on PC came in a smaller black box and self-booted. The game had (c) 1984 notices both in-game and on the box. 
- The [next print](https://www.sierrachest.com/index.php?a=games&id=362&title=championship-boxing&fld=box&pid=2) used a larger and lighter box that reflected Sierra's new logo and branding but used the same game code with the (c) 1984.
- A third and more common print updated the copy protection on disk and [copyright notice in-game](https://www.mobygames.com/game/4172/sierra-championship-boxing/screenshots/pc-booter/295285/) to (c) 1985. 
 
According to a 2021 [article by Nerdly Pleasures](https://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/2021/03/breaking-disk-based-protection-on.html), they claim the 1984 releases used Formaster Copylock as copy protection, and the 1985 release implemented the better Softgaurd Superlok protection scheme. 

Looking what's available online, there's three surviving pirated releases, two with the (c) 1984 and a floppy disk image with the (c) 1985.

The [floppy image](https://archive.org/details/002162-SierraChampionshipBoxing) copy contains four "1985" references including this 15th of April date, "04-15-85". But there's also a "15AUG84 04.30PM" timestamp embedded, plus "ABSBOOT v1.0 (c) Copyright Sierra On-Line, Inc. 1985" and "SIERRA CHAMPIONSHIP BOXING (c) Copyright 1985 Sierra On-Line,Inc. Programmed by Dave Murry Animation by Barry Murry" notices.

The 1987 cracked release of the game comes with the (c) 1984 notice and a completely different set of files to the Big Brother release. It is launched using `BOXING.COM` and has the following string, "Championship Boxing file loader - Version 1.0 11th February, 1987, by Bytten. Hi to The Nybbler, Junkyard Dog, RAS The Banshee, Phil Krakouer and all my other friends". Also within, "Copyright 1984 Dave Murry" is found in `BOXING.OVR` and "SIERRA CHAMPIONSHIP BOXING (c) Copyright 1984 Sierra On-Line,Inc. Programmed by Dave Murry Animation by Barry Murry" is found in `BOXING.MS2`.

Finally, we have this Big Brother release. Looking in the `KO.EXE` binary reveals the hidden message, `Championship Boxing$KO'd in 1984$by$BIG  BROTHER$   Hello Disklooker!!! Wie Gehts?`, German for "How are you?". As well as the same "SIERRA CHAMPIONSHIP BOXING (c) Copyright 1984 Sierra On-Line,Inc. Programmed by Dave Murry Animation by Barry Murry" title, but it is found in `INTRO.OLY`. 

However, the use of a MS-DOS, MZ EXE[^2] format binary for a pirate game launcher, back in 1984 is suspicious, as is the use of German[^1]. The `KO.EXE` and a dozen other files offer no last modification dates. Yet, many other files are marked as October 1983 or January and February 1984. Though there are a few files with March 1985 and it was packaged as `KO.ARC`, which was last modified on the 21st of March, 1986, still making it older than the 1987 Bytten crack.

[^1]: The cracker could have been a German speaker living in the USA or Canada. Or they could have ordered the game directly from Sierra and had it shipped it Europe. Though, international shipping would have made this expensive.
[^2]: The creation of `EXE` files would have required an expensive software compiler, the printed instruction manuals and the knowledge for use. Pascal and C compilers sold for between $300-500 USD in 1984, while Sierra Championship Boxing retailed for $40 USD.
