The **ACID Newsletter** has a storied history and started off way back in November 1990 with the founding of the group. Phantom, the operator of the board [XTC Systems](/g/xtc-systems-bbs), wrote a [formal document](/f/ab25c78) titled the "[ANSi Creators in Demand](/g/acid-productions), [ACiD] Newsletter #1". And in it, he introduces the group, its brief history, purpose, and original membership. Of the five members listed, [Phantom](https://demozoo.org/sceners/45876/) is the only one who isn't listed as an artist, but instead gets a "sysop / editor" credit, which would suggest there was an intention for future newsletters.

In an early 1992 [interview](/f/a91fc4e), Rad Man stated he wanted to do an _Acid Newsletter issue 2_ to be published in June or July. He goes on, "It will be programmed by the ex-Insanity magazine programmer, [Lord of Peasants](https://demozoo.org/sceners/47116/). Basically, it is going to be targeted towards people who want to know what's going on in the Acid Scene." This idea, however, expanded in scope and became **[The Product](/g/the-product)**, a magazine that for years had only a single issue.

Instead, the ACiD Newsletter returned in the December 1993 art pack, the _November update Acquisition_, as an ANSI text-formatted document, styled as a tabloid newspaper or a black and white print newsletter, and would occasionally be included in future [Acquisition](/g/the-acquisition) packs.
