Software Pirates from Texas is one of the oldest groups on the PC and one of the first enduring brands of the 1980s. By the end of the decade they were the longest running groups on the PC and one of the oldest in the world. Unusually, SPI kept themselves anonymous as there are rarely any BBS advertisements or credits. Only two people are ever mentioned in the collection of SPI artefacts, Softbeard (or Soft Beard) and Camel.

The other oddity of SPI is the graffiti they hacked into their game releases which often included a "**Copyright (c) 1991** by Software Pirates, INC" message into the game or game’s title screen. The 1991 reference is lost to time, but it definitely isn’t a release year. As the hacked releases often have file modification dates going back to 1985, and the release file archives themselves were obtained from a BBS backup compiled on January 1989.

SPI also created numerous custom utilities in addition to PC cracks and unprotects. Their most celebrated tool was SnatchIT, which when used with Central Point's [Copy II PC](https://winworldpc.com/product/copy-ii-pc/2xx), allowed self-booting PC games to be duplicated. Many PC pirate forums and BBSes of the 1980s were littered with [SEA compressed](https://www.pcjs.org/blog/2023/03/07/) `.ARC` archives containing `.CP2` floppy image files.

The couple of boards that were mentioned in 1987 release screens were, The Madd House (+713, Houston) and The Pirate's Cove (+305, Miami).
