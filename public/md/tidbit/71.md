**TRiNiTY Game Reviews** were a long running PC-release review group that might have first appeared late 1992 as a subsection in issues of the Scene magazines [Illustrator 1](/f/a45db) and [Lancelot \]\[ issue 3](/f/a57c2). The reviews continued on for years, long after Lancelot \]\[ stopped publishing and were mostly comprised of an ANSI text file, a viewer and sometimes some attach screenshots.
