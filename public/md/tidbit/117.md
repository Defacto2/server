**ACME** is a generic group name that has been in use many times.

The 1990 [iteration](/f/b12385a) was a cracking group from Sacramento, California. Its boards were [The Underworld](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1242/), the [Phun Line](https://demozoo.org/bbs/9067/), [The Welfare Department](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7509/). And members included, Jimbo, Dark One, Argonaut, Nighteing, Axiom Codex, and Road Rebel.

A another [iteration](/f/b11cedc) of ACME or **ÆCMΣ** existed in October 1993 as a cracking group. Members included, Melkor, Sid Vicious, Mr. Brownstone, Klaus. 

There were also unrelated ACME groups in Brazil (+55) and from 1993-1998, an **[ACME demogroup](https://demozoo.org/groups/472/)** from The Netherlands (+33).

**ACME 1996** released [Virtua Fighter for Windows 95](/f/a51c4f2) in October 1996. Its members included, "Sokratez, Plato, Duck Rogers, Darkseed, Wizzard, Fox Mulder".

Finally there was a **TEAM ACME** from 2003-onwards. In their [Trillian Pro](/f/a82e755) release they write, "Born due the merge of two well known groups that brought you quality releases over years, ACME is now almost one year old and delivered more than 1700 quality releases, most of em being keymakers." The 2004 release of [FlashEnjoy](/f/b52cff2) claims credit for 2700 releases.
