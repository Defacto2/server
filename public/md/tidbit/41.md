The German Alpha Flight started releasing on the Commodore 64 in at least 1986. The team joined the Amiga platform the following year. But on the PC, AFL didn’t release until many years later, with a team in Belgium waiting until Christmas 1992. The Belgium group changed brands to the Outlaws by mid-1993. And regular AFL releases didn’t occur until late 1993 under a new German lead team. But for reasons unknown, this group re-branded themselves as Storm Inc. However, AFL PC returned in 1994 under new, international membership being lead out of the USA and Australia.
