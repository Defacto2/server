In the first **ANSi Creators in Demand** [newsletter](/f/ab25c78) from November 1990, Phantom wrote that ACiD is a new, ANSI artists group. 
"We don't claim to ever release any games, or other such nonsense, that is reserved for groups such as [INC](/g/international-network-of-crackers). 
What we are here to do is make ANSi's." 
Phantom jokes about credit card payments being accepted, then corrects himself and makes the point that ACiD's ANSi requests are free, though sysops are free to throw in some extra (warez) download credits. 
Which is ironic because later, the artists of ACiD would become the first major group to demand cash payments for their artwork.

The founding members were the president, Rad Man, Phantom, and artists Shadow Demon, Grimm, and The Beholder. 
Its two boards were Phantom's [X-T-C Systems](/g/xtc-systems-bbs) [^1] in Austin, Texas, and Shadow Demon's [911 is a Joke](/g/911-is-a-joke-bbs) [^2] in New York.
It's hard to pinpoint when ACiD first formed; however, Rad Man has claimed in [an interview](/f/a91fc4e) published in May 1992, "Acid was founded in 1990, in September".
This correlates with self-dated artworks we have for both A.A.A. and ACiD affiliations that go to the end of September.
