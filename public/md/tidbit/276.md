**Datazine** was a pet project of [2tuff](https://demozoo.org/sceners/28632/) from the UK who rewrite game industry news previews from EDGE magazine and other sources and review console games.

Issue 2 includes: 

An interview with [Dream-Master](https://demozoo.org/sceners/68007/) (DM) from the UK of Illusion on console and Delirium of Amiga. 

The interview [Maximilien](https://demozoo.org/sceners/15339/), leader of Paradox as some interesting comments. On the SNES he states, "Console are for sure cool, but the scene sucks a bit, first it is too small, then it needs more coders/console fans, most of the people on it are just amigadude taking a break on console. So it stays really a sub-scene of the amiga scene."

2tuff inteviews himself?
