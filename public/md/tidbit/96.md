The Myth Inc Link BBS (+513) from Cincinnati was the [board](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12549/) of Ironman.

The board seems to have been a source of PC game supplies and initially released under their own name before teaming up with [The PTL Club](/g/ptl-club) to co-release titles. In the July 1988 release of [High Seas](/f/b92dcca) we see, "The M.Y.T.H. Inc Link BBS Present HIGH SEAS, With Thanks To Ironman". While in the same month The PTL Club release of [Uninvited](/f/bc309ae) has "The PTL Club / MYTH / CPI Present UNINVITED, Thanks To Ironman!". But by the November 1988, The PTL Club release of [Skate or Die](/f/b427e66), The M.Y.T.H. Inc Link BBS has become a PTL Club board, and these co-releases stop.

It was [announced](/f/ad4905) at the start of 1989 that the board and the group had ended, "Second order of business... MYTH Inc. has gone down which I am sure most of you know because it went down January 1st 1989. It's a shame to see such a good board go down. I'm not sure if the Buyer's Group is going to die or not but hopefully not since Vortex has taken over Myth's place.".

The many, convoluted variants of this board and group include:

- MYTH
- MYTH Inc
- M.Y.T.H. Buyer's Group
- M.Y.T.H. Inc.
- M.Y.T.H. Inc. Buyer's Group
- M.Y.T.H. Inc. Link Buyer's Group
- M.Y.T.H. Inc. Link BBS
- The M.Y.T.H. Inc. Link BBS
