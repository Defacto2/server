**Miami Cracking Machine** was a game cracking group founded by Line Noise in 1988, who according to reports was very young[^1] and had a lot of money to spend on his hobby.

MCM often released with the tagling, "The MCM Presents...", however early on they used "MCM Group Presents".

The earliest release we have is Presumed Guility from March 1989, which list members, Line Noise, Lord Michael, Mr. Clean, Dr. Jeckyl, Joe Johnson. And these boards from Florida, [Star Frontiers](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3796/), [Shadowgate](https://demozoo.org/bbs/11841/), [Sentry's Post](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7689/), plus [The Copyworks Inc](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7690/) from Houston, Texas.

The main crackers for MCM were Patch, Megaton Man, The Cyborg, R. Bubba Magillicutty.

Continuing with the PC Scene trend[^2] of including a custom crack screen in their releases. MCM seems to be the first to include a high-resolution, EGA graphic mode with the June 1989 release of USS Stinger and [credited](http://localhost:1323/f/a92ba9) to Mr. Clean.

[^1]: In a March 1993 [interview](/f/a72d0b) with Adrenalin, Line Noise stated his age was 17, which would have made him 12 or 13 in 1988. In the interview he stated, "You have to keep in mind, I've always been thought of by everyone around here as the mature one. I always wanted to be an adult if you know what I mean, and I never acted my age."
