Lancelot was a PC game review magazine created by members of The Dream Team / TRSi [cooperation](/g/coop). The both issues from August 1991 reviewed ten games each and used a novel review scoring system, inspired from the UK gaming press.

A technical note, the [first issue](/f/a55b7) uses the numeric keys for navigation, `2` for down and `8` for up.
