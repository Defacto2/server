**Insanity** started life in 1991 as "iNSANiTY: The Official Insane Creator Magazine" from [iCE](/g/insane-creators-enterprise). Programmed by [Lord of Peasants](https://demozoo.org/sceners/47116/) and edited by [Black Spyrit](https://demozoo.org/sceners/17391/) and [Frozen Tormentor](https://demozoo.org/sceners/40155/) it had a heavy focus on both the elite piracy and artscene found on the PC at the time.

What is interesting is how candid some of the articles are about the members of iCE. In the first issue for example, iCE president Frozen Tormentor scores out of ten, the members of the group, both in their ANSI and VGA artistic skills.

[**Issue 1**](/f/a245a) from September 1991, has [KingPin](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46111) writing "Drawing Realistic ANSis" with examples, Lord of Peasants complains about all the other magazines on the elite PC Scene, Black Spyrit reviews group cracktros, and The Warden lists the best boards to call.

[**Issue 2**](/f/a3436) from October starts with Black Spyrit writing, "Insanity #1 appeared almost totally as an 'iCE' magazine, however we have decided to steer somewhat away from that in an attempt to create a more general 'pirate' magazine."

In another article Black Spyrit also talks about becoming president of iCE. "Basically, Frozen Tormentor[^1] has dropped out of iCE and sold his modem. This means Black Spyrit (me) is now the president of iCE."

[Opus Outland](https://demozoo.org/sceners/45836/) writes "About [DnA]"[^3].
[Genesis](https://demozoo.org/sceners/45880) has a two-part article, "The Official Story on [USA/Fairlight](/g/united-software-association*fairlight)".
And Zodact creates a "Cracking Group Chart" for September which INC just ahead of both Razor 1911 and the COOP[^2].

There are three interviews, the first with [Vega 7](https://demozoo.org/sceners/146449/) about [PSI](/g/pirates-sick-of-initials) founder, [Malignant Growth](https://demozoo.org/sceners/59022/). The second is with [Crzy Joe](https://demozoo.org/sceners/47089/) the vice president of [NEUA](/g/national-elite-underground-alliance). And finally, [Belgarion](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46605/) formerly of The Humble Guys and The Festering Pit BBS, on why he sold his modem and quit.

In the news and rumors for the past month,

- The Gecko of INC and his board House of Rage have quit the Scene.
- They claim The Humble Guys stole the release of Willy Beamish from USA.
- A new group Empire is formed by Public Enemy, TWA, Phoenix and Syndicate.
- Byter's Lexicon CAE has gone private, it used to be a board free of any accounts.
- "Skid Row are paying crackers to crack for them on the PC."

[**Issue 3**](/f/a4792) from December is the last known issue. 

In it [X-Terminator](https://demozoo.org/sceners/112816/) compiles "The Ware Report" for November, which lists USA/Fairlight as the best group, INC in second and The Dread Team with Skid Row in third.
"The FiRM" by Lord Mischief claims the [group](/g/the-firm) was founded in 1986, however, this is a misrepresentation of the facts. As The Firm was the result of a merger between multiple groups in 1989, [one of these](/g/five-o) went back to 1986.

[The Byter](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46496/) writes about his Celerity BBS software, Lord Tracer on Oblivion/2. [Gnarly Beast](https://demozoo.org/sceners/47044/) talks on being an Australian in the Scene in 1991 and all the assumed clich√©s. [Tarl Cabot](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46680/) "Life of a Courier". [Father Time](https://demozoo.org/sceners/117851/) briefly reviews: Celerity, LSD, Velocity, ViSiON/X, Odessa, Extreme, Prism BBS software, and more thorough reviews of Cyber and Extreme.

Interviews include [Claude Rains](/p/claude-rains), author of [RELEASES](/g/game-release-list), and the famous cracker, [Rescue Raider](/g/rescue-raider).

In the news and rumors for the past month,

- Grimm and Frozen Tormentor form a new artgroup[^4], The New Order (TNO). Grimm was previously the vice president of ACID and Frozen Tormentor was the retired founder of iCE.
- Artgroups: ACiD, iCE, and RPM join together under "ACiD Productions" lead by Rad Man, Black Spyrit, Honus Wagner. The "Productions" suffix is to take into account the new VGA art division from RPM[^4].

[^1]: Frozen Tormentor was the founder and previous president of iCE. It sounds likely he suffered from burnout.
[^2]: The COOP was Tristar Red Sector Inc and The Dream Team.
[^3]: [Digital Noise Alliance](/g/digital-noise-alliance)
[^4]: In the same issue, Legacy of Excellence by Force Ten covers this in more detail, including the creation of The New Order and the new ACiD Productions.
