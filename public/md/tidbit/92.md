The Knights of the Round Table or the awkward **TKRT** were a cracking and documenation group on the PC in 1988-89. Their home seemed to be Texas based BBS, [The Round Table](https://demozoo.org/bbs/11932/) (+713). Like some other PC groups of the 1980s, TKRT had a novel copyright notice, "Copyright 1988-1999."

The two known crackers of the group were The Black Knight and Electra who were system operators of The Round Table. However, it was suggested that the group was a fraud. In July 1989 [Mind Shadow wrote](/f/a87b3), "So here goes...about 3 months ago I was trying to start up a group called KORT (Knight's of the Round Table). I had no idea that there already existed a group called TKRT. (And TKRT was a loser cracking group stealing cracks at that)."

By April 1989, they had three other boards, Fortress of the Demons, [Puerto Pirates](https://demozoo.org/bbs/11839/), and Yo Conservatory.
