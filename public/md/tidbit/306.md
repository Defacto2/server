**The Worldwide Amiga BBS List** or **The Monthly Amiga BBS Telephone Book** is a list of over 1100 Commodore Amiga boards from around the world. However, these boards were not necessarily "elite".

The lists were divided into multiple parts.

- 1. United States separated by state
- 2. Canada separated by province
- 3. Asia, Australia and Europe listed by country
