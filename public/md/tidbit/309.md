**VLAD** magazine was a publication of the virus group Virus Laboratories and Distribution. However, despite the group name Metabolis write, "You may notice something in all of the VLAD source code, the lack of destructive code" "Destructive code makes the scene bad for everyone. When there's a major _trashing_ by a bew virus it gives (all) virus authors a shit name, and people generally believe that we're computer vandals."

Though, non-destructive viruses were often still annoying and unwanted.
