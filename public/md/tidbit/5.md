There is little known about the IPL other than it was hacked into the title screen of a 1984 release of Archon and the 1984 release of Racter. It is possible both these releases were put out by “The IPL” in 1984, or at a later date as the release archives we have access to are not original.

However, the release of Racter does advertise a board from the Chicago metropolitan area in Illinois. So, IPL might be The **Illinois Pirate..?**
