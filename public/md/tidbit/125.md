Disassemblers of America or D.O.A. were a game cheat group from 1990. It's home board [Realm of Heroes](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7719/) was based in New York.

Both members, [Byte](/p/byte) and Buccaneer were also in [The Warez Alliance](/g/the-warez-alliance), a cracking group that also shared the same home board.
