**The Humble Review** published by **THG F/X**[^1] has ties to [The Humble Guys](/g/the-humble-guys) and was a one off magazine from December 1991 that was very popular in the day. Though I am not sure why as it is horrible to read due to poor font choices, random colors, and ALL CAPS TEXT. But maybe audiences cared more about the programmed visual effects and music vibes than the content?

The programming duties were mostly down to [Sauron](/p/sauron), author of the famous THG Intro Makers[^2] that got used by many boards to create their BBStros and adverts. The Humble Review also collaborated with [Galactic Review](/g/galactic-review) and its issue #12 becoming a core part of the magazine. 

Also of note is a great, two-part interview with [Byter](/p/the-byter) who talks of the Apple II pirate scene. And is the author of the Celerity BBS software, operator of [Lexicon of the Cabal](https://demozoo.org/bbs/6248/) and author of [The Ware Report](/g/the-ware-report) also from 1991.

[^2]: The THG Intro Makers were a set of programs that allowed non-programmers to create their own intros and adverts by providing text, a background image, music, and a few other options.
