**Sony PlayStation (PSX) Report** from May 1995 is compiled by [Ironcode](https://demozoo.org/sceners/66624/) from Switzerland. Its starts with a hardware and software introduction on the original PlayStation, which was Sony's first foray into the gaming console market. At the time there was no known piracy on the machine due to its black CD media.

"The blackness is to keep counterfeiting from happening at all. You see, Sony writes "unformatted tracks" to the disk that the O/S checks for, you have to be able to write bad tracks to copy the disk but if you don't know where the bad tracks are, then you can't copy it." "Contrary to what has been said, there isn't any bootlegs going around of Playstation games."
