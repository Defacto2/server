**CyberMail** (CM) entered the crowed market of piracy magazines beginning with "Welcome to CyberMail. We are a new electronic magazine designed at bringing non-biased news and information to the masses.". It is edited by Riptide with Dee and programmed by Warhammer from Brisbane Austraia.

It seems Dee lost interest in the magazine. Now the confusing part is either, Riptide renamed himself to Wartide. Or Riptide and Warhammer were the same person and merged their online profiles to become WarTide. Regardless, the magazine does complete change of focus from issue 2 and becomes a regional Scene magazine for Brisbane, Australia that is run by WarTide formerly of [Affinity](/g/affinity).
