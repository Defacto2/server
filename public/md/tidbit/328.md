MindBender in the War of the Warez writes, "What happened then was calling cards got canceled, boards got busted, internet saved the warez-trade to not fall-apart completely and last BUT NOT LEAST... floppy games were replaced with huge CD-ROM games."

"Another important fact is that many of the CD-ROM releases of today aint even cracked when being released... give all the credit of the releases to the group that make the game run with a working crack"

"Another big dispute that occured is the one concerning where to put the warez first (bbs vs ftp). My mind tells me it doesnt really matter where you put the releases first as long as all groups agree on putting them at the same spot."

[MindBender](https://demozoo.org/sceners/35368/) writes on CD-ripping, "6 months has gone since [Hybrid introduced CD-ripping](/f/a938e5) to the scene. Yes, I know [TDU-JAM](/g/tdu_jam) first started but here we're talking about actual rips and not the [huge releases done by TDU-JAM](/f/b61d166). Hybrid started up with myself, [Hoson](https://demozoo.org/sceners/16470/), [Cyber](https://demozoo.org/sceners/18750/) and a few others re-releasing software in better ripped and working versions... Time went and CD-rips became the only thing left as the floppy-games started to go CD only. Major floppy groups like Genesis, Eclipse and Razor 1911 changed their labels into TDUJAM, Hybrid and RazorCD. In late 1995, TDUJAM decided to resign from what they had started and left Hybrid & RazorCD + a bunch of small groups in charge of the CD-releases. Hybrid & RazorCD agreed on a 30-disk limit
to all games ripped from CD."

The Lord of Darkness on the Internet pens, "During the days where the scene was primarily run thru bulletin boards, only a certain few with the proper connections and know-how could be a part of the scene. Thus leaving out all the other lamers who just joined to be cool etc. The scene was a "private" underground operation, and not everyone knew about it. No need to say, it wasn't accessible to the general public, as it is now.
I believe that in all the benefits the internet has brought to the scene, there is an equal amount of downsides. Due to the internet, the scene has grown rapidly to become a monster operation which is out in the open. This has poisoned the foundation in which we stand on"
