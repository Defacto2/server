The Mickey Mouse Club or MMC was a Denver (+303) cracking and documenation group that also published the hack and phreak newsletter Hackers Unlimited. 

In the March 1990, [issue #2](/f/b02672a) they write, "The Mickey Mouse Club was founded by Cardiac Arrest and The Dark Lord. The name MMC came about because we couldn't think of a better one. We are basically a cracking club. Aside from cracking, we write instructional text files, and an electronic magazine called Hackers Unlimited Magazine, designed to help beginning hackers and phreakers. We are also the authors of programs such as Data Protect, a file that, as the name implies, provides features such as data ecnryption/decryption, file hiding, file clearing, and several other functions."
