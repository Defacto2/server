The Assembly Language "Magazine" was a four issue publication from 1989 but is not a "Scene" publication and was anti-piracy. Its home board was The AsmLang & CFS BBS from San Jose. An introduction found in the first issue writes, "This is to be a publication devoted to Assembly language programming and to the Assembly language programmer. At first look it might appear that it is to be a pclone only forum, but that is not the intention or the desire."
