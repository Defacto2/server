**[Bounty Hunter](/p/bounty-hunter)'s National Pirate List**[^1] was a large list of PC (and occasional Amiga) pirate or warez bulletin boards from the USA in 1990. And it might have previously known as "The Bounty Hunter - Hunters Pirate List".

The May 1990 publication contained 448 boards and  the June release had 522. It's home was the infamous [Rusty n Edie's](https://demozoo.org/bbs/4671/)[^2] BBS in Ohio.
