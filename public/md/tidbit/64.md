**Razor 1911** was a cracking-demo group on the PC, Commodore Amiga, and C-64. An [introduction](https://web.archive.org/web/19961227152420/http://www.razor1911.com/) by co-founder Sector9 says the Norwegian group was formed in October 1985 on the C-64 as _Razor 2992_. [Releases](https://csdb.dk/group/?id=431) for the system show they experimented with many names, _[Razor](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=116448)_ in 1985, _[Razor Group Inc. 1911](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=24468)_, _Razor Inc._, _[Razor Software Systems 1911](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=238948)_, _[Razor in 1911](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=24499)_, _[1911 Razor](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=229829)_, and the famous _[Razor 1911](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=24472)_ in 1986.

And while there were [suggestions](https://csdb.dk/release/?id=47094) in 1986 that some members were planning to move on from the C-64, and over to the novel, technically superior Commodore Amiga. The group would not release on the Amiga until 1988, where they would crack and release demos for [some years](https://janeway.exotica.org.uk/author.php?what=0&id=338&query=&cat=0&tag=&show=10&sort=Year&order=asc), before first [retiring](https://janeway.exotica.org.uk/release.php?id=74767) the system in 1993.

Some of the founding members moved to the PC in the middle of 1991. But, unlike other European groups who made a PC switch, Razor would emphasize games by USA publishers. For much of 1992, they expanded in North America. Unfortunately, except for their [7th anniversary](/f/aa4ba1) release, Razor's membership on the PC was kept hidden. The group only mentions the roles of couriers and lists their bulletin board affiliations.

Unusually, a comprehensive member list is found in the May 1993 release of [SiLk!](/f/b126c88). It is [abruptly censored](/f/ad1d0c8) in future releases due to some unrelated busts. Before, seeing the group restoring a [reduced membership](/f/a8222bc) listing that includes some fun job descriptions. However, by this time, the Norwegian members have faded, and references to the group's European origins are mostly forgotten.

March 1994 saw the release of the <strong>first demo</strong> by Razor on the PC, named [RED](/f/ab445e). It was well received and saw a new _Razor 1911 Coding/Training/Art Departments_ in the [NFO listings](/f/af2e8ab) and a return of a Norwegian PO Box. The famous, Razor 1911 text-logo by \<[JED](https://16colo.rs/artist/jed)\> of ACiD was used in [Battle Isle 2](/f/b31a533), and revised by someone unknown, into its final form for the release of [Doom 2](/f/ac4af9) in August.

The start of 1995 saw the outspoken The Renegade Chemist leave Razor and [attempt to kill the group](/f/ab3a82). But he forgot to get a consensus and the group [happily continued](/f/af1aaf1). Yet, he acknowledged the group's problems, including a lack of funds, and the rapid death of the medium Razor released for, PC floppy disk games.

To solve these issues, the new leadership found novel ways to raise funds. Decades before social media influencers did the same, Razor 1911 advertised and sold merchandise directly to its online fan base. Initially, they [shipped a t-shirt](/f/a82163f) that sold well, but far more successful was the commemorative Anniversary CD-ROM, with a large collection of their [questionable](/f/a42df1) PC and Amiga releases. And, to solve the dwindling supply of games being published on floppy disks in 1995, Razor [released Tyran](/f/ad4a55) as a full compact disc, under a new **CD Division** label. This newfound adaptability would allow the group to grow in the decades to come.
