**Razor 1911** was a cracking group that was founded in Norway in 1985 on the Commodore 64 as _Razor 2992_. Some of the founding members jumped to the PC in mid-1991 and unlike other European groups, Razor heavily focused on North American releases. For much of 1992, the group expanded and with the exception of their [7th-anniversary release](/f/aa4ba1), they often didn't list members, only couriers and boards. However the growth in the group can be seen in the number of BBS affiliations.

A comprehensive member list was returned to the May 1993 release of [SiLk!](/f/b126c88), but within a week it got [abruptly censored](/f/ad1d0c8), probably due to unrelated European busts. Before finally [listing a reduced membership](/f/a8222bc) but with useful roles for the group. However, the original Norwegian members faded into the background and references to the Razor's European origins were removed.

March 1994 saw the release of the <strong>first demo</strong> by Razor on the PC, named [RED](/f/ab445e). It was well received and saw a new _Razor 1911 Coding/Training/Art Departments_ in the [NFO listings](/f/af2e8ab) and the return of the PO Box in Norway. The famous text Razor 1911 logo by &ltJED> of ACiD was prototyped in [Battle Isle 2](/f/b31a533) and revised into its final form for the release of [Doom 2](/f/b31a533) in August.

The start of 1995 saw the outspoken The Renegade Chemist leave Razor and [attempt to kill the group](/f/ab3a82) as he departed, but apparently he forgot to get consensus and [Razor happily continued](/f/af1aaf1). Yet he saw a couple of issues including a lack of money to obtain new games and the reduced number of game releases being published to floppy disks which Razor 1911 worked with. To raise funds, and decades before the mainstream influencers did the same, Razor 1911 created, advertised and sold merch directly to its online fans. Initially, they [shipped a t-shirt](/f/a82163f) that sold well, but later in the year, they developed a commemorative CD ROM with a large collection of their PC and Amiga releases! And to solve the dwindling supply of games being published on floppy disks, Razor [released Tyran](/f/ad4a55), the full compact disc under the new **CD Division** label.
