**The Spectrum** was a Canadian review magazine founded by Frost Bite for the PC Scene during 1990 and 1991. Scene game releases, cracking groups, and bulletin boards were all popular subjects for review.

While issue 1 is lost. Issues 2 and 3 load as "The Spectrum", but are titled "Spectrum Newsletter". The magazine application used a high resolution mode for the user-interface, but there is an easier to read text mode that is accessed by answering "N" to the question "Do you have an EGA or VGA  monitor?".

Issues 4, 5, and 6 used a new interface named "DMI" that is programmed by [Space Ace](/p/space-ace) of [DREAD](/g/dread). While technically better, it is clunky to use due to its choice of keybindings. Issue 6 also saw the founder of the magazine being removed from the staff due to internal bickering between himself and Space Ace who later [said](/f/ac1aaa2) of the incident, "Then it was time to flip out and kick out the president of the group." Frost Bite would then go on to write for [BaD](/g/bad-news).
