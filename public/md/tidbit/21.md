Faked, **public domain** releases were an odd but common tactic in the early to mid 1980s as a way for prohibited, cracked software to find their way onto legitimate online bulletin boards. Many boards of the era took a hard line against the distribution of commercial software on their systems, but were happy to host user-uploaded "public domain" software, which was a catch-all term for shareware, freeware as well as software that was released into the public domain.

Why pirates would want to upload fake public domain software is a mystery, but it could be that they were trying to avoid the attention of the board owners, or simply to troll.

In October 1985, [Tom Neff wrote](/f/a63e75), "These are illegally copied programs being distributed as "public domain" on various IBM PC bulletin boards across the country. Most of them are commercial pirate jobs, although a few of them are legitimate freeware or user supported programs that have been hacked up by people with warped minds."

A year later in October 1986, there were [reports](/f/a84ac1) of many dozens of games and applications that were being falsely distributed as public domain on bulletin boards.
