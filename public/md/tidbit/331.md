**The Reviewers Guild** or TGR was a programmed magazine that would review a single Scene release game. "We are a new Reviewing Group that aspires to provide all users with a detailed review of the latest games. We hope to have reviews that are a little more mature, in depth and useful for everyone to look at." Reviews would be more thougher than many other reviews of the time, including screenshots and a detail breakdown of the game, sound, graphics, playability and an overall rating. Early reviews included references to the pirated Scene release, but these were dropped, probably to appeal to a wider audience. The many of the earlier reviews would be penned by founder Freddy Krueger (FKrueger) who else where has stated he was been writting since January 1997.

BrAb of [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911), [Devotion](/g/devotion), and [Drink or Die](/g/drink-or-die) would release numerous Cheater Packs under his own name but by [pack #7](/f/a51932a) announced he would be releasing the packs in collaboration with The Reviewers Guild. "Well as some of u probably know I've been releasing Cheater Pack on my own. From this moment Cheater Pack will be officially released under TRG or as most of u know it as 'The Reviewrs Guild'. I was offered to do that few days ago by Toast and Freddy Krueger and I accepted it with great pleasure.".

The TRG would often be confused with [Ionizer's TGR](/g/the-game-review), another Scene game review publication from the same period.
