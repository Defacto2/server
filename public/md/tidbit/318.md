In the mid-1990s there are a lot of groups and magazine publications that called themselves Infinity. This is **Infinity Electronic Magazine** sometimes simplified to _Infinity E.mag_ by the artgroup Creators of Intense Art ([CiA](https://demozoo.org/groups/17338/)). It was edited by [Mr. Muff](https://demozoo.org/sceners/77964/) and programmed by [Wizard of Id](https://demozoo.org/sceners/109711/). It mostly reviewed in the form of commentary for the monthly releases by the artscene.

Issue 1 from March 1995 has:
- A history of CiA by Tron
- Mr. Muff asks, "What in the hell is IRC?"
- There's a plan for "#ANSI, The Gathering", a meetup in Virginia

<br>
- Issue 2 has an interview with T_Nothing, senior of [Union](https://demozoo.org/groups/58739/)
- In issue 3 [Edicius](https://demozoo.org/sceners/87179/) writes on the history of Jonas emag
- Issue 4 has Vyrus writing "Farewell" and an interview with Domino

<br>
Also in issue 4 Penguin suggests "The ANSi scene is dying. This is a small part of a huge problem. Boards are dropping dead like flies, even the most established ones in an area code... Through all this loss we can only see a lack of dedication represented by today's generation, and the monstrous side effects of the Internet."
