BSP was a Texas-centric group, probably founded in 1988. The key members of BSP would join The FiRM in March 1989 and would occasionally [be called](/f/ab2a1ce) the _Ex-BSP division_ in reference to this location. Some BSP releases from 1988 advertise the group as a division of Legions of Lucifer Inc. But this is not to be confused with the [Legions of Lucifer](https://textfiles.meulie.net/magazines/LOL/lol-20.phk) founded by Digitone Cypher in 1990 and became LoL-Phuck in 1991.
