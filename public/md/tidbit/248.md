**SPREADPOiNT/PC** was a PC cracking group from 1993-94. It was a sub-group of the famed [**SPREADPOiNT**](https://demozoo.org/groups/3361/) Amiga cracking and demo group that goes back to 1986, though the ties seem tenuous.

In the first newsletter, [CETiS](https://demozoo.org/sceners/25382/) of [ACiD](https://demozoo.org/groups/7647/) writes, "One of the members whom I am confused about is Fiona, the Fiona in our group is from the original SPREADPOiNT group and is a quality spreader from Germany, if this is the same Fiona as the one who is in the NTA staff, I guess we'll be sharing him."

The newsletter also states, "SPREADPOiNT/PC members are ... Bitmaster, Black Ranger, CETiS, Digital Interface, Dorion Hawkmoon, Fiona, Forced Entry, Fourth Reich, iCE-T, Insector X, Luke Skyywalker, MacBLUE, Macros, Marine, Midnight Rider, Oedipus, Phoenix, RAiDER, Shakattack, Spaceman Spiff, Spider, The Bainster, The Bloke, TMOD, and War Master."
