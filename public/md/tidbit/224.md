**Altered Reality** or **ALT** were a collective of programmers who wanted to publish a magazine, and in early 1992 released a (ed: lost) preview issue. They were hoping to have artists from the popular groups of the artscene supply artwork but ended up working with [Purple Haze](https://demozoo.org/groups/115048/) for the first issue. It was edited and programmed by [ColdSteel](https://demozoo.org/sceners/128489/) and he ran the magazine's home board [The Grave](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7648/) in the 516 area code (Long Island, New York).

The user interface is a bit odd, you need to press `F1` to access the article menu and you can use the left-right arrow keys to switch between individual articles. 

"Altered Reality really was suppost to take to its feet back in the beginning of 1992, but due to many problems it was delayed almost a year. For all of you that said this mag would never come out, I told you so! We are up and around looking better then any other vga mag that is currently out there."
