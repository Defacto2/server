**Insane Creators Enterprise** (iCE) Insane Creators Enterprise was a famous VGA and ANSI art group founded by Frozen Tormentor in January 1991. 

In a later interview for [Not! issue 4](/f/ae2ef4a), Frozen Tormentor confirms the founding month of January, but stated he and co-founder The Sorcerer originally wanted to start a PC cracking group, but neither of them could crack or supply. Instead, while they were creating art for their new group, "**Insane Crackers Eruption**", they decided to switch to "do some art groups, since that is where we had some talent". Frozen Tormentor would draw ANSI, and The Sorcerer worked on VGA pixel art.

In the interview, Frozen Tormentor also claims they were the first group to ever draw and build VGA loaders for bulletin board systems. And that they were the first to develop a method to convert Deluxe Paint `.LBM` image files into self-displaying PC applications. However, when asked, he claims the early turning point for iCE was after the remaining members of [Aces of ANSI Art](/g/aces-of-ansi-art), such as Slam Dunk and Mondoman, joined.

But it sounds likely that Frozen Tormentor suffered from burnout after selling his modem and exiting the scene in mid-1991. [The article](/f/a3436), 'What's up with iCE?' from October, sees the vice president, Black Spyrit, taking over the operations of the group.

An article by Force Ten found in [Insanity 3](/f/a4792) from December talks about a controversy in the later return of Frozen Tormentor. It is claimed he could not get back control of iCE, so he teamed up with Grimm, the vice president of rivals, [ACiD](/g/acid-productions), and they formed a new group that they'd both lead, **The New Order**. Accordingly, there was apparently a big drama involving lies and the attempt to steal members from both ACiD and iCE. As a consequence, worried about the "threat" from **TNO**, Black Spyrit, the leader of iCE, spoke to Rad Man, the leader of ACiD, and agreed to merge iCE into ACiD. This change, combined with the November 1991 merger of the art group [RPM](/g/relentless-pursuit-of-magnificence), caused ACiD to rename itself to **ACiD Productions**.

Back to that interview for Not! #4, Frozen Tormentor talks in depth about this situation, and it gets quite personal with the people involved. But he does say that Grimm was becoming disillusioned with ACiD and the leadership, and that's why he decided to cooperate and form The New Order.

Not all members of iCE joined the merger with ACiD, and the name continued. The group released their first monthly art pack in August 1992, months after their rivals, ACiD Productions, who released the first monthly pack in April.

And by December, it was reported that The New Order and iCE had teamed up to become known as **iCE:TNO**. This branding continued until sometime in early or mid-1992, when Frozen Tormentor again quit the scene, and The New Order brand was presumably retired.
