The Elemental's Pirate BBS List was a large collection numbers to pirate bulletin boards online in the USA in 1989. The lists seem to be specific to the PC pirate scene and includes details such as the software in use by the board "Soft", the speed "Baad", and sometimes group affiliations "Comment".
