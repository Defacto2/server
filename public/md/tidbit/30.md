**CMEN** was a parody group pretending to be from Australia, however was run out of the [Midnite Oil](https://demozoo.org/bbs/4661/) BBS in 214 (Dallas).

Housepet writes in BaD News [issue #7](/f/a846b), "Fake groups have been around for a long time. In recent times, the seminal "fake" group was CMEN. This group, theoretically based in Australia, was in fact headquartered in the Dallas, Texas area of the United States."
