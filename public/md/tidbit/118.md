**ACRONYM** was a short-live pairing of [Lord Zombie](/p/lord-zombie) and cracker [R. Bubba Magillicutty](r-budda-magillicutty) (RBM). Lord Zombie would end up in The Humble Guys, while RBM, having just left THG, would [join INC](/f/ae25546).

When you hear the word acronym, what do you think?  We think about
cracking groups.  Even if a group starts with a full name (The Humble
Guys, Public Enemy, etc.) it is quickly transformed into an acronym
(THG, PE, etc.)  We chose a one word name because we were tired of such
un-originality.  It is such un-originality that this group is vehemently
opposed to.  We are non-conformist, free-thinking individuals whom like
the unordinary.  Something no other group can offer, and never can.
Logically, we will be the only original group ever, because if another
original group comes along, they are deemed un-original for being
original because we were originally original.
