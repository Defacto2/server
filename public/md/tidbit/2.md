Five-O or Five O[^1] was the other enduring PC game group of the late 1980s[^2], having game releases going back to at least January 1986. It is a group mostly associated with the cracker **Mr. Camaro** whose name can be frequently seen in many releases from this period.

The collection here is definitely missing plenty of the known releases by Five O. As [Night Stalker](/f/ae2038a) from August, 1986 lists “Other cracks from Five O:” The Seven Cities of Gold, Wizard of Wall Street, Pinball Construction Set, The Music Construction Set, Conquest, that are all currently lost.

Only two boards were advertised by the group, the [Kingdom of Chaos](https://demozoo.org/bbs/4357/) (+612, Minneapolis) and The [Midnight Express](https://demozoo.org/bbs/8846/) (+305, Miami).

[^1]: Five-O, the letter O, not the number 0.
[^2]: [Software Pirates Inc](/g/software-pirates-inc) being the first.
