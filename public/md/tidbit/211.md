Despite the aesthetic, The Dark Wheel is not a product of the Scene, but a "compucomic". It is a series that was based on the computer game [Elite](https://www.mobygames.com/game/1324/elite/) and released on the then proprietory [CompuServe](https://www.wired.com/2009/09/0924compuserve-launches/) network and then later shared around on public and "elite" boards.
