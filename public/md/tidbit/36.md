According to Fabulous Furlough's [retirement letter](/f/b144a1), The Humble Guys were founded on the 22 January 1990.

The Humble Guys had a bit of a reputation, partly because they were [outspoken](/f/a93245), plus were quite happy to give [interviews](https://wayback.defacto2.net/the-scene-news-from-1999-september-14/interview-002.html) and write down their thoughts. If you believe what is sometimes said, there was virtually no PC Scene until they came around and revolutionised the platform using their hard earned experience from the competitive Commodore Scenes. Personally, I think this view is over sensationalised, and the Scene on the PC was [well established](/files/intro) long before THG appeared. Rather, PC Sceners in the 1980s were possibly older, more relaxed, and more interested in utility software than the games. 

But in saying that, THG really ramp up the release schedule for PC games and made it a more aggressive and competitive community, for good or ill. 
Many would argue they were the major force throughout 1990 and much of 1991. But became a shell of themselves after a number of people left to form [United Software Association](/g/united-software-association*fairlight) (USA) in September 1991. And again later, after more people quit the scene due to the [late January 1992 public arrests](/f/ab232ca) of two notable personalities.

We believe THG is the origin of the **`.NFO`** file extension with the minimal textfile `KNIGHTS.NFO` found in the release of [Knights of Legend](/f/ab3945) from the 23rd of January 1990. Knights of Legend from Origin Systems was most probably the first uploaded THG release, but required [a fix](/f/b02d22e) due to [an installation quirk](/f/b228b1a) and today is mostly forgotten. 

Two weeks later, [Bubble Bobble](/f/ab1eca6) was uploaded, and the included `BUBBLE.NFO` textfile had become bloated, with additional group greets, a "big yahoo", multiple board listings, a Nashville voicemail phone number and PO BOX.
