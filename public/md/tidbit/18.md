Canadian Pirates Inc. was a group based in its namesake country from the late 1980s. Most of the releases we have on-hand for CPI were collaborations with the PTL Club. In 1987 and 1988 these co-releases often advertised as “Another CPI/PTL production” or “PTL and CPI Present”, often with two same boards listed, [Swashbucklers II](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3668/) from Toronto and [Anarchy Burger II](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3823/) in Chicago.

In the January 1989 [PTL Club newsletter](/f/ad4905), [The Spiker](/p/the-spiker) writes of the CPI. 
"Somewhere along the lines, we merged with Canadian Pirates Inc. I believe was their acronym at first.. And then they changed to KGB.. KGB released a few cracks under PTL but seemed to fade away... They cracked that I can think of BoulderDash Construction Kit, [Ultima I](/f/ae3f82), and Might & Magic."
