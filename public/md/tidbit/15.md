March 1986 saw both TOADS and Five-O release custom CGA loader screens for their game releases. These screens were probably done in [PC Paint](https://winworldpc.com/product/pc-paint/100a) from Mouse Systems and were the first known scene art for the PC. It is unsure if the images were drawn by the credited crackers or by a separate artist.
