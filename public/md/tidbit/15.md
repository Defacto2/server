T.O.A.D.S. is an acronym that unfortunately has been lost. The group was active on the PC in 1986 though outside of these few artifacts there is no mention of them elsewhere. It is a shame as TOADS were pioneers for Scene art on the PC. Both with their custom, CGA loader screens used in their cracks and the text artwork used in their walk-through guide using characters unique to the IBM PC ([CP-437](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/cc195060(v=msdn.10))).

There are only two known members associated with TOADS, the cracker Shady Background and John Steed who wrote the Ancient Art of War at Sea documentation and most probably drew its art. Neither user is ever mentioned outside of this group.

The two boards advertised are the Celestial Toyroom (+312) from Chicago and Intergalactic Dismantling Inc. (+415) from the San Francisco Bay Area.
