Several conversations mention that **Silicon Dream Artists** had renamed themselves to **Graphics Rendered in Magnificence**. This would match the file modification dates from artpacks by both groups, with the last SDA artworks dated from June 1992, and the first **GRiM** appear in the same month.

According to Force Ten, a former SDA president, who wrote the introduction for the [GRiMOiRE artpark](/f/a619ba8) from August, "GRiM came into existence in late June of 1992, and the first release of the GRiMOiRE was the August release." The pack included 71 ANSI artworks and 10 VGA images.

Shihear Kallizad [wrote](/f/b02439a) that GRiM had previously merged into [Insane Creators Enterprise](/g/insane-creators-enterprise) (iCE). While in [The Illustrator](/f/a45db) from November 1992, there's a reprint of the _iCE Newsletter #2_ that announces GRiM has merged into iCE, and both the GRiM and GRiMOiRE brands have been retired.
