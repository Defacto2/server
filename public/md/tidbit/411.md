**Hybrid**'s first release, the cracked preview of Prehistorik 2, was first shared on the 15th March 1993. The included [cracktro](/f/ae20876) programmed Cyber of Sweden scrolls, _Welcome to our first release. A very nice preview of a very nice platform game, which is very similar to Joe and Mac! Credits for this intro go to The Sarge/FLT for the graphics, Cyber for the coding, and the music was ripped out from MIG-29 Super Fulcrum..._

The early Hybrid leadership were previously part of the Commodore Amiga Scene. But were snobbish when it came to PC tradition of using text files in releases to convey group information. They thought it was cooler to waste our time and to embed the text into the cracktros, making it annoying to skim read or copy and paste. _.NFO files SUCK! I dunno who [invented](/f/ae2da98) them, but remember that they were uninvented by HOSON & LOWTEC._

Both Hoson of Sweden and Lowtec of Germany were cofounders, with Hoson in an [interview](/f/9f1bf) saying, _I founded Hybrid together with a german guy called LowTec back in Winter 1993._ In another [interview](/f/a5168) he'd state, _So I got in contact with The Panterh, Wolverine, The Magic Artist, LowTec and some other peeps... 2 months later [**Pyradical**](/g/pyradical) died so I picked up the valuable parts and formed Hybrid... this was in February 1993..._

In a later [interview](/f/ab170), Hoson spoke of the idea for the group. 
_Hybrid was created in February 1993 by myself and a German fella named LowTec. 
We were initially members of a group named Pyradical, but they died and we decided to make something new.
We originated from the Amiga-scene, and both wanted to make a group that was much like the Amiga-groups had been, using intros in front of our cracked games, making trainers, no couriers, etc._

This first iteration of Hybrid would last for half a year before the group merged into [**The Dream Team**](/g/the-dream-team). But, there was also a spin-off **Hybrid Console Division** that isn't too well known, though in one [release](/f/ac1e8f9), it listed the following members: 
_Cevin Key - Hoson - Hurricane - Maelstrom - Radio Active - Rygar - The Bugger_
