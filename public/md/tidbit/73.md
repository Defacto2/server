The Amatuer Crackist Tutorial from 1988 was created by [The PTL Club](/g/ptl-club) during a time when there was a shortage of crackers on the PC. Itâ€™s a guide that is designed to educate readers new to the basics of software cracking and using unprotect text documents. "Due to the current lack of Crackers, and also keeping in mind the time it took me to learn the basics of cracking, I decided to put this tutorial together. I will include many files which I have found helpful in my many cracking endeavors."

The primary editor for this guide was [Specular Vision](/p/specular-vision), while [Mr. Transistor](/p/mr-transistor) and Ironman offered additional commentary. Additional thanks were given to [The Grand Elusion](/p/the-grand-elusion) and [Banzai Buckaroo](/p/buckaroo-banzai). And all were members of The PTL Club except for Banzai, who had authored the [Cracking 101](/g/cracking-101) series in 1986.
