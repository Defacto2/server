**Zenith 'Zine** (ZZ) was a monthly magazine by the group New Zealand Scene programming group KiRRA and edited by Abaddon with War Pig.

In the introduction to the first issue, they write "As you know KiRRA has been around for quite a while. But in recent times we haven't exactly made too much of an impact... Time has been spent on members boards, WWW pages and other projects."

The first issue offers three programming tutorials, Learning Pascal from the Beginning, HTML 101 and HTML Advanced which includes early JS, all displayed in a useless low resolution italic font. There's also a review of the Scene release of Quake, and a collection of group NFOs.

The second issue has a cover story covering some Scene drama in the local Auckland area code and another Pascal programming tutorial.
