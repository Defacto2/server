**German Modem Scene Report** from July 1994 is authored by [Jordan](https://demozoo.org/sceners/23748/), system operator of the [Laserdance](https://demozoo.org/bbs/5565/) BBS. 

He writes, "I think these are the words that indirectly display the current status of the German modem scene. And i Say Modem Scene because of you go for the mailswawpping/coder/demoscene and so on then u find yourself in a totally different world."

Ironically, decades later, this is still true online today. "The other big problem is the amount of OLD kiddies,who like the anonymity behind their computers, and try to compense their complexes by beating shit out of other people"
