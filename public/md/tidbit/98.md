Unfortunately there is no information available for ECP other than this mention by the cracker [The Elemental](/p/the-elemental)[^1] for the game of Bad Dudes.

The two ECP boards listed are [Faw or Foad](https://demozoo.org/bbs/8923/) from Florida and CIA, which could from [Atlanta](https://demozoo.org/bbs/11542/), [Orange County](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7746/), or elsewhere.

[^1]: The Elemental was the author of the The Elemental's [Pirate BBS list](/g/the-elementals-piratelist), a newsletter from May 1989 with a large list of elite North American PC boards.
