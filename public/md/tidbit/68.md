The Dream Team was based in Sweden and was a name frequently associated with its founder, Hard Core. A programmer who had somewhat of an early reputation for creating second-rate intros on the PC on behalf of the group. Though, we do credit him with creating the first contemporary PC cracktro with this great [musical skull intro](/f/b01ca10) from November 1991. As a side note, his intros are the most annoying pieces of shit to preserve, as they have numerous dependencies that were intentionally hidden in releases. If an intro on this page doesn't work right, it is probably missing a hidden file or two.

The Dream Team enjoyed success and remained active for much of the early 1990s, despite the occasional [hiccup](/f/b5261b0), until quietly retiring at the end of 1993. With only the occasional [guest release](/f/a93193), the TDT name disappeared from the scene for 16 months before [returning](/f/b72e5db) in 1995 and tried rebuilding itself from the ground up with only four members. But this second attempt wasn't as successful and the group for the most part stopped releasing after four months, and completely vanished in November.
