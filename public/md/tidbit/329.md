**Reality Check Network** (RCN) went with the prototype name of Reality Check is an infamous piracy magazine launched by [Tsunami](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149314/), Krypton and programmed by [Xenon](https://demozoo.org/sceners/88506/). It was launched by and evenutally outlasted its parent group [Legacy](https://demozoo.org/groups/68042/). Blowing up in popularity with its solid application code, usable design and love of reporting Scene drama, that, due to the rise of the Internet was often petty, realtime and novel. But today, we'll skip over those as no one cares about the IRC chat channel takeovers that occured in 1995.

[Issue 1](/f/a9652) opened with the statement, "We are a new network aimed at bring the news to the masses, without needless (ed: group) propaganda." that was signed by Krypton/Tsunami[^1]. It has an interview with [The Wicked One](https://demozoo.org/sceners/85519/), president of [MindCrash](https://demozoo.org/groups/85513/) couriers.

[Issue 2](/f/a15e8) interviews [Dorian](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46466/), leader of [Malice](https://demozoo.org/groups/46350/). And Suicide president of [RiGiD](https://demozoo.org/groups/80448/). [Bluewater](https://demozoo.org/sceners/106075/) of [Hybrid](/g/hybrid) complains about [Razor CD](/g/razor-1911-cd-division), who are avoiding the traditional methods of confirming a release by skipping uploads to BBSes, and instead uploading releases straight to the "elite" sites on the Internet.

[Issue 3](/f/a2544) interviews [LeodLion](https://demozoo.org/sceners/82006/), [fATE](https://demozoo.org/groups/88422/) senior. Hitex complains about people faking releases using his group.

[Issue 4](/f/a3520) interviews [TKLP](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46989/), child president of [ROR](https://demozoo.org/groups/81464/). [Rebel Chicken](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149314/) writes commentary on the retirement of [TDU-Jam!](https://demozoo.org/groups/46640/).

[Issue 5](/f/a449c) interviews Lightning and Vertigo-X formerly of [High Tech Couriers](https://demozoo.org/groups/78926/). Road Rebel writes commentary on the downside of the Scene's (then recent) move to the Internet. His example describes how Hybrid released the hotly anticipated [release](/f/aa3cdd) for 1995, WarCraft 2. That apparently had a problem after level four, and triggered a ton of endusers to spam the group's realtime chat channel (IRC). With the kind of behavior that would be familiar today with social media. There were false claims of the release infected with viruses, streams of "hybrid sucks" "all their shit sucks" "hybrid should disband in disgrace", typical entitled outrage culture, but this example reflects that it's existed online since day one.

[Issue 6](/f/a5478) interviews [Katz](https://demozoo.org/sceners/85117/), formerly a senior of High Tech Couriers, but she talks about her new group [Solar](https://demozoo.org/groups/81469/).

[Issue 7](/f/a67d4) interviews with [Blackened](https://demozoo.org/sceners/85003/) of [Domination in Couriering](https://demozoo.org/groups/84999/). Readers of Inquisition will see familar interviewees, [White Cracker](https://demozoo.org/sceners/88476/) about the former High Tech Couriers and [Ordnance](https://demozoo.org/sceners/113444/) on RTS.

[Issue 8](/f/a77b0) offers an "exclusive" interview with an FBI agent involved with computer crimes. Evil Current of RTS talks about Razor/Genesis/Hybrid. Manic talks about Blitzkrieg and Legacy.

[Issue 9](/f/a872c) has an interview with [Omnibuz](https://demozoo.org/sceners/80512/), leader of [Rebels](/g/rebels). Demonic talks about [ViPER](https://demozoo.org/groups/124038/), an unusual courier and artgroup.

[Issue 10](/f/a9688) covers the unexcepted Boxing Day passing of Scene programmer Spyder-X, and interviews [Motiv8](/g/motiv8) president [Mason](https://demozoo.org/sceners/16043/). There are reports on the [Assassin's Guild](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1631/) BBS bust.

[Issue 11](/f/aa664) magazine founders Hitex and Rebel Chicken are interviewed about their other gig, Legacy. Nikeman of the courier group Motiv8 briefly talks about their abandonment of BBSes for Internet sites. Zipe, president of [Rush](https://demozoo.org/groups/81665/) (1996) is interviewed. There's a reprint of a message written by [Crackpot](https://demozoo.org/sceners/71537/), sysop of [Park Central](https://demozoo.org/bbs/2980/) BBS, about his annoyance with the behavior of Razor 1911 and their public complaints about his board. And Hitex pens an article on the Internet vs BBSes debate.

Rebel Chicken regrets his time on the scene and is hopeful of having time to return to Church. Hitex feels hollow after a year of constant online activity. And Akira 7 just wanted to smell the roses.

[Issue 14](/f/a453a) sees the team return after three months with the same staff. There's a really odd interview with a fATE courier named Tsunami, who claims he was busted for using a "shared" account (ed: a known hacked account used by multiple people) at Sydney University. That got used by someone to successfully hack into "a U.S. missle base".

David & Goliath are interviewed about PWA and The Corporation merge. Lester, Amnesia leader is interviewed. Everclear discusses RiSC, Razor, and Scum. And Rapid Motion talks about his group [Hostile](https://demozoo.org/groups/88105/).
