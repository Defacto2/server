**Reality Check Network** (RCN, prerelease name Reality Check) is a famous piracy magazine launched by [Tsunami](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149314/), Krypton and programmed by [Xenon](https://demozoo.org/sceners/88506/). It was launched by and eventually outlasted its parent group [Legacy](https://demozoo.org/groups/68042/). RCN blew up in popularity with its solid application code, usable design and a love of reporting novel Scene drama. Drama that due to the rise of the Internet was often petty and realtime. But today, we'll skip over these, as no one cares about Internet chat channel takeovers or the reporting of courier groups that existed for three weeks. The issues have been classified into volumes, and Volume 2 is where the magazine was at its peak growth.

###### Volume 1

[Issue 1](/f/a9652) opened with the statement, "We are a new network aimed at bring the news to the masses, without needless (ed: group) propaganda." that was signed by Krypton/Tsunami[^1]. It has an interview with [The Wicked One](https://demozoo.org/sceners/85519/), president of [MindCrash](https://demozoo.org/groups/85513/) couriers.

[Issue 2](/f/a15e8) interviews [Dorian](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46466/), leader of [Malice](https://demozoo.org/groups/46350/). And Suicide president of [RiGiD](https://demozoo.org/groups/80448/). [Bluewater](https://demozoo.org/sceners/106075/) of [Hybrid](/g/hybrid) complains about [Razor CD](/g/razor-1911-cd-division), who are avoiding the traditional methods of confirming a release by skipping uploads to BBSes, and instead uploading releases straight to the "elite" sites on the Internet.

[Issue 3](/f/a2544) interviews [LeodLion](https://demozoo.org/sceners/82006/), [fATE](https://demozoo.org/groups/88422/) senior. [Hitex](https://demozoo.org/sceners/147267/) complains about people faking releases using his group.

[Issue 4](/f/a3520) interviews [TKLP](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46989/), child president of [ROR](https://demozoo.org/groups/81464/). [Rebel Chicken](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149314/) writes commentary on the retirement of [TDU-Jam!](https://demozoo.org/groups/46640/).

[Issue 5](/f/a449c) interviews Lightning and Vertigo-X formerly of [High Tech Couriers](https://demozoo.org/groups/78926/). [Road Rebel](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149329/) writes commentary on the downside of the Scene's (then recent) move to the Internet. His example describes how [Hybrid](/g/hybrid) released the hotly anticipated [release](/f/aa3cdd) for 1995, WarCraft 2. That apparently had a problem after level four, and triggered a ton of end users to spam the group's realtime chat channel (IRC). With the kind of behavior that would be familiar today with social media. There were false claims of the release infected with viruses, streams of "hybrid sucks" "all their shit sucks" "hybrid should disband in disgrace", typical entitled outrage culture, but this example reflects that it's existed online since day one.

[Issue 6](/f/a5478) interviews [Katz](https://demozoo.org/sceners/85117/), formerly a senior of High Tech Couriers, but she talks about her new group [Solar](https://demozoo.org/groups/81469/).

[Issue 7](/f/a67d4) interviews with [Blackened](https://demozoo.org/sceners/85003/) of [Domination in Couriering](https://demozoo.org/groups/84999/). Readers of [Inquisition](/g/inquisition) will see familar interviewees, [White Cracker](https://demozoo.org/sceners/88476/) about the former High Tech Couriers and [Ordnance](https://demozoo.org/sceners/113444/) on [RTS](/g/request-to-send).

[Issue 8](/f/a77b0) offers an "exclusive" interview with an FBI agent involved with computer crimes. Evil Current of RTS talks about Razor/Genesis/Hybrid. Manic talks about [Blitzkrieg](https://demozoo.org/groups/132290/) and Legacy.

[Issue 9](/f/a872c) has an interview with [Omnibuz](https://demozoo.org/sceners/80512/), leader of [Rebels](/g/rebels). Demonic talks about [ViPER](https://demozoo.org/groups/124038/), an unusual courier and artgroup.

[Issue 10](/f/a9688) covers the unexcepted Boxing Day passing of Scene programmer Spyder-X, and interviews [Motiv8](/g/motiv8) president [Mason](https://demozoo.org/sceners/16043/). There are reports on the [Assassin's Guild](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1631/) BBS bust.

[Issue 11](/f/aa664) magazine founders Hitex and Rebel Chicken are interviewed about their other gig, Legacy. Nikeman of the courier group Motiv8 briefly talks about their abandonment of BBSes for Internet sites. Zipe, president of [Rush](https://demozoo.org/groups/81665/) (1996) is interviewed. There's a reprint of a message written by [Crackpot](https://demozoo.org/sceners/71537/), sysop of [Park Central](https://demozoo.org/bbs/2980/) BBS, about his annoyance with the behavior of [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911) and their public complaints about his board. And Hitex pens an article on the Internet vs BBSes debate.

[Issue 12](/f/a25e2) sees an interview with anonymous employee or rep of Apogee Software[^2], a popular publisher of PC games. Majorr is interviewed about [Sodom](/g/sodom). 

[Issue 13](/f/a355e) from February 1996 saw the magazine founders publish their "See ya.." articles closing the first chapter of the magazine. Rebel Chicken regrets his time on the scene and is hopeful of having time to return to church. Hitex feels hollow after a year of constant online activity. And Akira 7 just wanted to smell the roses.

###### Volume 2

[Issue 14](/f/a453a) sees the team return after three months with the same staff. There's a really odd interview with a fATE courier named Tsunami, who claims he was busted for using a "shared" account (ed: a known hacked account used by multiple people) at Sydney University. He claims this account got used by some people to successfully hack into "a U.S. missile base"? David & Goliath are interviewed about [PWA](/g/pirates-with-attitudes) and [The Corporation](/g/the-corporation) merge. Lester, [Amnesia](/g/amnesia) leader is interviewed. Everclear discusses RiSC, Razor, and Scum. And Rapid Motion talks about his group [Hostile](https://demozoo.org/groups/88105/).

[Issue 16](/f/a6472) has [Pitbull](https://demozoo.org/sceners/89687/), future Razor 1911 leader, writing in to welcome RCN back. [Shadow Master](https://demozoo.org/sceners/15651/), supplier and leader of [Prestige](/p/prestige), formerly of Legend, [Genesis](/g/genesis), [TDU-Jam](/g/tdu_jam) and Razor 1911, and active since 1990 also writes in to vent on [Napalm](/g/napalm). Zieg of fATE passes away. It is packed with interviews:

- Shadow Master of Prestige

- Shatter of [DOD](/g/drink-or-die)/Napalm/[RiSC](/g/rise-in-superior-couriering) and siteop of LA

Daviolator leader of Napalm is interviewed. Also interviewed is Tok, leader of Sodom; Met of Rebels; Endeavour founder of the spam group, [COPS](/g/couriers-of-pirated-software) (Couriers of Pirated Software). It is reported [Demaxxus](https://demozoo.org/sceners/84980/) is busted by the RCMP. Hitex sings the praises of Prestige. Lost Soul, cracker of Napalm complains about the lack of respect.

Bollox writes in to give a history the Scene, before the days of warez, "Before there were warez, there was H/P/A/V/C." Faraway is interviewed about the Japanese SNES emulator Super Paso Windows and `#SNESEmu` chat channel. Also interviewed is Dupe president of [Eclipse](/g/eclipse).

Garf writes on The Death of Bulletin Board Systems, "If you think about it, just last year BBSes were far more popular than IRC (Internet Relay Chat). Lately, however, BBSes have been at a sharp downfall and at this rate, they will become extinct in the near future."

Hidden in this issue is a small letter by Cypher from Ontario (613). "I'm just letting you guys know how terrible the BBS scene is getting. Seems that thousands of locals are getting FTP sites and crap like that and becoming instant "warez gods." My opinion is that CDROM and the Internet combined have totally destroyed what used to be a fun little divesrion."

Also interviewed are The Midnight Gravedigger (MGD) the top ~~scene addict~~ courier, Zima Man senior of [Pinnacle](/g/pinnacle), Kang of The Hardened Criminals ([THC](https://demozoo.org/groups/81509/)).

He claims even in August 1996 boards were paying $100-200 US a month for a major group distribution affiliation. And goes on to say, Hybrid do not pay cash to their software suppliers, Prestige do, Razor 1911 only pay for gaming industry "inside jobs", and Reflux do not.

Toast of Razor 1911 writes on the Toronto Scene Gathering that was held at a local restaurant and bar, where 40-50 Sceners attended.

[Issue 38](/f/aa756) is titled "Another Chapter Ends" and is the farewell issue. Krypto writes that he lacked the time to maintain the magazine. And fellow editor Billy Phuz writes, "It's happening to us, people...  life is catching up to us." And finally Helter departs with, "The scene gave that to me, it gave me a place where I could be proud of myself and what I could do, it gave me some ground to stand on."
