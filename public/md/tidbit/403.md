Superior Art Creations, or SAC, was unique, being a PC art-group, possibly the first German art group founded by six digital artists in December 1994. Unlike the more common demo-groups in Europe, art-groups were more familiar in North America, focusing on text art, pixel, and "hi-res" image artworks, in addition to intros and crack-intros.

One of the founders, Roy/SAC, maintains online an extensive archive of the group and its output.
With the group releasing thirty-six art packs from 1994 through to 2009.
And over hundred unique crack-intros and other intros for numbers groups, 
Razor 1911, Hoodlum, Hybrid, Genesis, Paradigm, Prestige, TDU-Jam, TRSi, Myth, and many more.
