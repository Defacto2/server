**The Union of Crackers** or **UoC** were founded by former members of [INC](/g/international-network-of-crackers) and [TRIAD](/g/triad), shared a similar origin to a few other groups of the era, such as [PETRA](/g/petra) or [PSI](/g/pirates-sick-of-initials).

The cracker of the group was Le Chat. 

The two boards were, TSIE Project and The Mystical Phorest, both unknown, but most-certainly in the United States.
