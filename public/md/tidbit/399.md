Fan of the group [Shihear Kallizad](https://demozoo.org/sceners/40186/) of [TRiBE](/g/tribe) wrote the article, _A Valiant Effort_ in his magazine, [Paradigm Press #1](/f/b1268aa), and he packaged an art pack for Valiant, even though he was never a member.

In the article, he writes that the group broke up in late June or early July 1993 after its leader, Quick Silver, quit the art scene. Its other head, Havoc, decided to move on to [Acid Production](/g/acid-productions), and many members then followed suit. Then, after a misunderstanding, some of these former members ended up in [iCE Advertisements](/g/insane-creators-enterprise) instead.

He went on to say, "Valiant, in their short stint of existence, produced some very fine, high-quality pieces. 
Some may one day make more than one person's list of all-time greats."
