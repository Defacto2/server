It is unknown what FFA stood for but they were based in Orange County, California and we have a couple of releases from October 1989.

In the release of [Double Dragon II](/f/a61dcc0), the members mentioned are Screach Sinthasizer, Televangalist, Asmodeus, Ice. The group ANSI and EGA artist was [Merk](/p/merk).
