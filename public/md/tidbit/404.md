**Paradigm** began its life under the title **Zeus**, self-named after the famous game supplier who had in the past been tied to [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911) and his friend, The Renegade Chemist. It started small with just four members: Crackpot, John Lennon, White Knight, and Zeus. The group name was intended as a joke that fast became [stale](/f/a64314), "Over the next week or so, ZEUS will no longer have the same name as me. It was meant to be funny...and it was, but it's no name for a group."

The group's first release, [SimCopter](/f/b427e9c), on the 8th October 1995, would turn out to be a flop, both for the developer Maxis and the group. With Zeus, (the person) later [writing](/f/a64314), _It's so much easier to ignore problems with previous games, but we refuse to do so. SimCopter has bugs in it, no question. I always said "if it looks like beta, smells like beta, plays like beta..." I should have checked this one out further, but I didn't, and now everyone seems to have it. It has nothing to do with the rip (since it was only the radio), but the game itself._

The "**rip**" that Zeus mentions was a new form of release that groups were still getting the hang of. Instead of releasing the whole game, cracked and compressed as archives of individual floppy disks. Game publishers for the PC in 1994 and 1995 had controversially abandoned the medium and moved on to mandating games being exclusively sold on CD-ROM. For pirates, though, this was a conundrum, as many CD-ROM games were simply too large to share on BBSes and over the Internet. So they developed the technique of removing or ripping out parts of the game they deemed unnecessary to reduce its overall size. What was "unnecessary" was up for debate, with many pirated games of this era feeling incomplete, especially as a game's soundtrack, speech, and the cutscenes being prime targets for removal.

Less than two weeks after the release of SimCopter, the group Zeus renamed to Paradigm and remarked that it is pronounced pair-a-dime. Paradigm had expanded rapidly to almost 20 members by the time of their first [release](/f/a62c0c), the sports game FIFA 97. And there's a telling note with the state of PC gaming of the time, despite being over a year since the hyped release of Windows 95, Paradigm chose to only release the DOS version of the game. "There is a windows 95 version on the same cd...but who cares! If you play games, then you know DOS is best."

For its first couple of years, Paradigm would also be known for its more innovative cracktros. The group collaborated with the Finnish demogroup [Halcyon](https://demozoo.org/groups/125/) to design compact intros that were very contemporary, rather than the common crack-intros clichés inspired by the late 1980s Commodore microcomputers.

Over the years, the group's fortunes in the Scene would ebb and flow, sometimes due to inactivity, and even a failed merger with [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911) in early 1997. And while they often got the top-tier game titles, like many rip groups of the era, it wasn't uncommon to see non-functional releases by the group due to rushed, untested games. The group and brand would be a mainstay for the Scene until February 2000, when it was announced in the [release](/f/ad49a8) of **Myth**'s Whitetail Extreme, "[MYTH](/g/myth) is the new star in the gaming heaven. We have been founded by members of the groups PARADiGM and [ORiGiN](/g/origin)."

Before the merger, the group would also release entire CD images of PC and PlayStation games under the names **Paradigm ISO**, and **PDMISO**. Our earliest archived [release](/f/b3202e0) dates to September 1998, but the term ISO is [mentioned](/f/b01b0e8) back in July, _PDMISO is looking for ISO sites._ This brand separation continued until March 1999 when it was announced in HERETIC 2 V1.04 UPDATE that PDMISO is no longer, _All ISO and PSX titles will now be done under the PARADiGM name. There was no sense in making a seperate name for the same group._

There was also an attempt at a Scene journal, **DOT Magazine**. The journal looks to be unreleased or lost, but there was a 19th January 1999 [announcement](/f/a3370a), _Paradigm have begun work on DOT Magazine, the first "real" disk magazine to hit the PC scene. Combining the powers of the online media, with those of the printed media, Dot Magazine will offer the scene a so far unrivaled present - to actually support the scene - not just report from it._ And an optimistic [update](/f/a82c40) in March, _DOT MAGAZINE is nearing a release date! We are looking for gifted reporters who can cover the PC ISO and RIP scene - aswell as reporters who knows the PSX and N64 scene in-depth. Contact dot\_mag@hotmail.com._

And finally, a [forgotten](/f/c030da4) artgroup named **DAC**, or the **Digital Art Community**, _The Digital Art Community (DAC) is recruiting! www.pdmworld.com/dac/ for more information, or #dac on efnet._
