In 1990 some of the boards and members would end up in [The Humble Guys](/g/the-humble-guys), including The Tardis that would become the infamous [The Slave Den](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1473/) and Elm Street.

Crysmal, Spyder Bytes, were the crackers and Freddy Krueger, Ancient One supplied.

Boards include, [Ulterior Motives \]\[](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3688/), [Tardis](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3684/), [Ozone](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3685/), [Darkmoor Hold](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3686/), [Elm Street](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3691/).
