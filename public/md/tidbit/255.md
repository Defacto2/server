**UnReal** had a few names, "UnReal EGA Magazine", "UnReal Pirate Magazine", and "UnReaL e-mag".

The editorial in issue 1 says the magazine started in the 604 area code (British Columbia) by [Hologram](https://demozoo.org/sceners/25877/), [Innate Malice](/sceners/28440/), [Bone Crusher](https://demozoo.org/sceners/119662/), and later joined by [The BBS Bouncer](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46365/) who is the editor. [VIP](https://demozoo.org/sceners/30728/) of [The Emulator Institute](https://demozoo.org/groups/8023/) did the programming.

[Issue 1](/f/a254d) from December 1993 has a brief article by [JED](https://demozoo.org/sceners/14213/) of ACiD on "The ANSi Scene" and "CCi Just Won't Die" by [Nemesis](https://demozoo.org/sceners/30743/).

[Issue 2](/f/a3529) from January 1994 has "The warez scene and stuff" by [Gank Master](https://demozoo.org/sceners/28409/), "[HaTE](https://demozoo.org/groups/131594/): The True Story" by Eight Balls. 

[Issue 3](/f/a4485) from September 1995 wrote "Neither (issue 1 or 2) was an 'official' release, however, and issue represents UnReal's first public appearance." "UnReal was started by Bone Crusher and later merged with [DiAMOND](https://demozoo.org/groups/131634/), a mag run by Hologram and Innate Malice of ACiD... UnReal will try to focus on the 'underground' computer art scene while providing a smattering of information on the underground scene as a whole."

Issue 3 is much larger than the previous two with a heavy focus on group reviews. It is programmed by Innate Malice, who also co-edited with [Ranma](https://demozoo.org/sceners/119103/).

Articles on groups include: [ACiD](https://demozoo.org/groups/7647/), [iCE](https://demozoo.org/groups/2196/), [Legend](https://demozoo.org/groups/110517/), [Mistigris](https://demozoo.org/groups/22737/), [Motion](https://demozoo.org/groups/86618/), [Spastic](https://demozoo.org/groups/110755/).
