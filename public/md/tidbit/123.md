**DeAD** were an "elite" artgroup meaning they often created ANSI art and branding for pirate and other underground boards. Besides text art they also created BBStros and cracktros with graphics that used the contemporary VGA-mode and most of its artists were from the United States.

While DEAD originally stood for, "Damn excellent Ansi Designers", however in 1992 the acronym was often swapped out with "Damn Excellent Art Designers" or "Danm Excellent Artistic Designers".

There are three surviving artpacks from DEAD, one from [July 1992](https://16colo.rs/pack/dead), and [two others](https://16colo.rs/group/dead) from mid-1993, when the group started using the `.DEA` file extension for their ANSI artworks.
