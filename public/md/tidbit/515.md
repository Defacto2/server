March 1986 saw both TOADS and Five-O include CGA loader-screens in their game releases. These sometimes crude screens were probably done in [PC Paint](https://winworldpc.com/product/pc-paint/100a) from Mouse Systems and were the first known Scene art for the PC. It is unsure if the works were drawn by the credited crackers or by an unaccredited artist. 

The PC Paint application had been around for a couple of years by 1986, however the software used a custom image file format `.PIC`. It might have taken a while before people worked out how to embed these images into loaders and programs to be displayed without the use of PC Paint.
