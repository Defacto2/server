There is little known about The Illinois Pirates other than these releases from 1985. The release of One-on-One includes an advert for the Chicago based BBS, [Celestial Toyroom](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12354/), a board later advertised by [TOADS](/f/bb2e428). And the [release](/f/bc30a5b) of their King's Quest walkthrough, which is the earliest known scene documentation for a PC exclusive game. The text, "The Illinois Pirates" header found in the walkthrough is the earliest example we have of the IBM PC character set being used to create a logo or text art. Unlike ASCII text, the distinctive IBM PC character sets would not display properly on other systems.
