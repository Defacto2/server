There is little known about the Illinois Pirates other than these releases from 1985. The release of One-on-One includes an advert for the Chicago based BBS, Celestial Toyroom, a board later advertised by [TOADS](/f/bb2e428). And the release of their King's Quest walkthrough, which is the earliest known scene documentation for a PC exclusive game.
