**SCD** started out as **Southern California Distribution** as a regional distribution network. As such, in November 1990 they published a newsletter for DOS known as **The SCD Report** to inform the pirate community. Over a span of two years, 14 issues of The SCD Report were published and the magazine was well received. However, December 1992 saw some changes, with not only seeing a rewrite of the magazine application, user interface and a re-branding to **Software Chronicles Digest**, but also it became the final issue.

The magazine editor was Atz, system operator for [Infinite Illumination](https://demozoo.org/bbs/6249/) in Orange County, California.

Some article highlights include:

- Two retrospective articles in [issue 3](/f/a04b7), covering both the BBS scene and the top games of 1990.
- [Issue 5](/f/a278f) would introduce [The Byter](/p/the-byter)'s Ware Report and game reviews.
