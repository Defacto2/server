SCD started out as **Southern California Distribution** and was part of a larger regional release group. As such, in November 1990 they published a newsletter for DOS known as **The SCD Report** to inform the pirate community. Over a span of two years, 14 issues of The SCD Report were published and the magazine was well received. However, December 1992 saw some changes, with not only seeing a rewrite of the magazine application, user interface and a re-branding to Software Chronicles Digest, but also it became the final issue.
