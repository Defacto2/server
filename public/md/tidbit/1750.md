In April 1993 it was [announced](/f/b62bc5b) that THG/FX were no more and the members had joined iCE Advertisements. "iCE soon managed to bring about a merger with the famous folks at THG/FX. Yes, that's right... we would like to proudly welcome Sauron, Iridium (formerly Quick Silver), ZigZag, and Renegade Bithead to iCE's expanding coding department. I can't even begin to describe how much of a pleasure it has been to work these guys in the past month. Their motivation, intuitiveness, and know how are definite assets to the group no matter which way you look at it."
