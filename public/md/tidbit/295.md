**Ransom** from 1994 mostly released reviews of PC games but also the [occasional](/f/ad24a16) utility or application warez under **RANSOM PC/CONSOLE** or **RANSOM IBM/CONSOLE** and always led by [Critical Mass](https://demozoo.org/sceners/78602/).

There was another Ransom group led by [Death Karnage](https://demozoo.org/sceners/79224/) from 1993, and its WHQ was [Amber](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1744/) (914) run by [Corwin of Amber](https://demozoo.org/sceners/48957/) but we don't know if the two groups are related or what it did. However the Ranson of 1994 NFOs often contained "Notes : RANSOM IS BACK IN ACTION!".
