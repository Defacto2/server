**Scooby Snack Magazine** or SSM was a humor magazine released in 1996. It was created for Windows 95 and like many Scene products in the first few years of this operating system, the interface and article pager is awful. I could get it to launch in Windows 2000, however the menu can be flaky. The editor seemed to be Shadow Knight and programmed by Smurfer. The issues have a "Scene related" section but the articles are usually brief. 

Note, the download archive for issue 1 is missing the program executable.
