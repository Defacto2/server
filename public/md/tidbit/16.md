C&M is an little known PC cracking group from 1987 that branded themselves as **-=C&M=-**. Of the artefacts we have, there are three names mentioned, [Zanna Martin](/p/zanna-martin), Mack Boland and Major Havoc.

Zanna Martin was the primary cracker and released Ace of Aces for C&M in early September 1987. Yet, in that same month, would be credited and crack [The Boys from Company C](/g/boys-from-company-c)â€™s release of [Dark Castle](/f/b52410a). So it could be assumed C&M either died or was abandoned sometime in that month.

Major Havoc from Maryland was the system operator of the [Freeworld 2](https://demozoo.org/bbs/11829/) BBS and lists their personal affiliations as: "Major Havoc (301)/Phortune 500/-=C&M=-". The 301 is a telephone area code, while [Phortune 500](https://demozoo.org/groups/89794/) was a phone-phreak group.
