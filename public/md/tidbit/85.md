In a December 1988 [interview](http://janeway.exotica.org.uk/target.php?idp=6375&idr=1940&tgt=1), Fairlight co-founder Strider states his age was 18, and got serious about piracy in 1985. He goes on to say Fairlight was founded on the Commodore 64 and Amiga microcomputer platforms in March 1987 by himself, Gollum and Black Shadow. The ancient [Background page](https://web.archive.org/web/19990222020755/http://www.fairlight.org/background.html) of `fairlight.org` goes into drama of the founding by the teenagers. And the [Intros page](https://web.archive.org/web/19990128174247/http://www.fairlight.org/intros.html) of the same site offers a great list with screenshots of the 1980s intros and cracktros.

In an April 2008 [article](https://alt.politics.republicans.narkive.com/I7xN7Xnp/san-diego-gop-chairman-co-founded-international-piracy-ring) (original is lost) published on [Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/), it was revealed that the San Diego GOP (Republican Party) chairman was indeed Strider, who had immigrated to the US 1992 on a H1B visa and became a US citizen in 2003. "Online research reveals that Krvaric is the co-founder of Fairlight, a band of software crackers which later evolved into an international video and software piracy group that law enforcement authorities say is among the world's largest such crime rings."

More controversy occurred in August 2020, when the local San Diego PBS television affiliate [reported](https://www.kpbs.org/news/evening-edition/2020/08/21/video-surfaces-images-hitler-and-tony-krvaric) on the Fairlight demo [Space Age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6SS8TE6c4o), released for the Commodore Amiga [in 1989](https://demozoo.org/productions/243679/) that displays a few photos of Strider, and some other members plus an animated Hitler sprite bouncing around the screen. Strider's individual photo appears 25 seconds into the demo with the text, "Kill a commie, coz here's Strider!", though [stupid](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14342020/when-prince-harry-nazi-uniform-why-apology/), this probably was tongue in cheek.
