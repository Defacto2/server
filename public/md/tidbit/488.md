The **Untouchables** were a jack-of-all-trades group, releasing both games and applications, plus freeware previews, software cracks, and game trainers. 

In addition, they operated an art group, **Untouchable Art**, which released a single art pack with both VGA art and ANSI pieces for known bulletin boards. The art group comprised three members, a large number of sites, and they were also listed in The Untouchables NFOs until mid-April 1993.
