**The PTL Club** was an unusual name in its day, having been taken from a [televangelist talk show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125638/)[^6] that was on air in the 1970s and 80s. The group released numerous PC games, both old and new for over two years. Operating from at least mid-1987 until November 1989 when they teamed up with a number of friendly groups and boards to unify under the new name [TRIAD](/g/triad).

Just before the merger, the [listed](/f/a93469) members: Jenetic Bytemare, The Grand Elusion, Desert Foxx, Bad Brains, Claude Rains, Specular Vision, The Shadow, The Spiker, The Prophet, and Cyfer.

The primary crackers for The PTL Club in were:

- 1987 Death Star, Mr. Transistor[^2], Bad Brains[^3]
- 1988 Mr. Transistor, The Grand Elusion
- 1989 The Grand Elusion, Jenetic Bytemare, Specular Vision, Cyfer

In many releases, the suppliers of the games were credited to a “Buyer’s Group”. Being a vague description, it is uncertain if this meant people contributed money to buy the game for release, like an executive producer or if it was a way to anonymize the credit. However, sometimes a BBS Buyer's Group would be thanked. For example, "The PTL Club and the Buyer's Group Presents: Shadowgate"[^1], "Network 23 Buyer’s Group"[^4], and "M.Y.T.H. Inc. Link Buyer's Group"[^5].

There are a couple of unusual releases from 1987, that today might be considered stolen or fake releases. First is the December 1987 release of [Jungle Hunt](/f/ac37b2) that has a PTL crack screen crediting Mr. Transistor, however the game itself has been graffitied with "Leechsoft Presents" that replaces "Atarisoft Presents" and "Cracked By Mr. Big Bopper" instead of a ["(C) 1984 Atari"](https://www.mobygames.com/game/133/jungle-hunt/screenshots/pc-booter/949/) notice.

The other oddity is the release of [Test Drive](/f/b62d082) which includes an `INFO.PTL` textfile, but has a crack screen by The Boys from Company C with a reference to cracker Zanna Martin. The PTL Club textfile has no mention of BCC and claims it was cracked by Death Star. Yet the release archive `TD.ARC` looks original, with its last modification set to 20th November 1987, a date that correlates to MobyGames listing the [US release date](https://www.mobygames.com/game/107/test-drive/releases/) for Test Drive as December 1987.

In the May 1989 release of [Rasterscan](/f/b5261a6), cracker The Grand Elusion was worried the group was in its last days, possibly due to the strong competition from [The FiRM](/g/the-firm). "I'm afraid I am the harbinger of ill tidings. This may very well be the last PTL Club crack." "It seems like I'm the only one left doing any of the cracking. And I'm getting too old".
