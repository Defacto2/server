In the readme of the first [Mirage Compendium](/f/af3403) from June 1992, **Mirage Graphic Designs** was founded on 20 October 1991 by Kaska F. Kaska in California. 
However, it was publicly announced on January 15, 1992, with the intention of providing free art for bulletin boards and user groups.

In the Mirage [Compendium 3](/f/b1375b), it was announced that [License to Draw](/g/licensed-to-draw) had merged on 5th September 1992. And a week later, on the 13th, a small group named House also merged.

Mirage [Compendium 6](/f/b72b16a) released on the 15th January 1994, became the final art pack for the group, being tagged "the final joke". The readme contains farewell messages from numerous former members, and according to r.noble, some members went to [ACiD](/g/acid-productions), others to [TRiBE](/g/tribe), and a few left the scene.
