In May of 1998 Freddy Krueger, founder of The Reviewers Guild penned the first editorial for a new gaming website, **GameOver Online Magazine** @ `www.game-over.net`. "GameOver: The Next Evolution. It has been in production now for several months, so it is with great pleasure that we finally open the doors of the new Online Magazine, GameOver! A joint venture between The Reviewers Guild and The Gamer's Edge, GameOver promises to be informative, unique, and definitely controversial... but that's just the way we like it!"  "GameOver is the first Online Magazine dedicated to the scene. If it relates to the Gaming Scene, we'll have it here for you." In an early 1999 capture by [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/19981111185826/http://www.game-over.net/), the contact email is listed as `fkrueger@game-over.net`.

However, by the year 2000, the magazine dropped all references to the Scene and was now attempting to be a traditional ligitmate gaming website, with an advertising income. Though it would be curious to know where they sourced their games for review.
