**WaVe** was first published by The Council (CNC) from Germany before becoming a standalone group from issue 5. The magazine and group went under a few names, WaVe MaGaZiâˆ©e, Wave Magazine, and The Council who were previously Cyrap 'n' Couriers which is where the initialism **CNC** comes from. The magazine was a mix of German piracy, literature and artgroup Scene coverage. 

Issues were originally edited by Chug Lee (CL) who was the founder of CNC and programmed by ViLLAiN. But later issues were helped out by Rave. Issue 11 was the last for 1996 and the DOS operating system. Issue 12 and 13 came out over a year later in early 1998 but were for Windows 95.
