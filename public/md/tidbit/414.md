The final **Pentagram** [release](/f/ae27dcb) would occur at the end of October 1994 with little fanfare. But behind the scenes, Dr. Insanity would [post](/f/a7312e) on the 4th of November, _I want to welcome everyone to the new venture that PENTAGRAM and [LEGEND](/g/legend) have agreed upon: [GεNεSiS](/g/genesis)!_ 
<br>
And the first **Genesis** [release](/f/aa2f4f), Sim City 2000 for Windows would proclaim, _No, your eyes are not deceiving you... PENTAGRAM and LEGEND have decided to merge forces to form an entirely new group, more powerful than ever, to completely dominate the scene! Expect much more, very soon from the unbeatable combination of PENTAGRAM and LEGEND: GENESIS!_  _DR. INSANITY & FANFAN LATULIPE & TAZMAN_
