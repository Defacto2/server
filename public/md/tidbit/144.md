**PoWR**, Inc were a cracking group that later switched to releasing documentation and running PoWR-Net, a BBS message base.

Their original "contract" cracker was Sun Tzu. Michael Myers was the leader, while Gopher, Doctor PJ, and Gnat were also members. Byter and Captain Hook could have also been members.

The only boards known were Doctor PJ's "[PJ's Tower](https://demozoo.org/bbs/9875/)" and in 1992, [The Two-Minute Warning](https://demozoo.org/bbs/9257/).
