**Sam Brown** owner and system operator of the Byte Bandits BBS in California[^1], was a cracker and programmer on the PC, and the author of the popular [Emulex](https://demozoo.org/bbs/tagged/emulex-bbs/) BBS software.

In 1987 Sam would release cracks under Byte Bandits, but would also promote other pirate boards in those releases. For example, the March release of [Destroyer](/f/a6222ce) lists the phone numbers for both SwashBucklers and Fone Conspiracy. By mid-87, a few system operators, [Bad Brains](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3995/), [Mr. Hood](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12534/), and Sam Brown collaborated under the [OCCULT](/g/occult-network) network. However, before years end Bad Brains would be in the PTL Club for reasons unknown. Itâ€™s not sure why Sam advertised other boards, maybe he was friends with the operators, or they run his Emulex BBS software?

[^1]: By October 1989 the BBS changed numbers to a +404 Atlanta, Georgia area code.
