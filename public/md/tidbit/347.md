**Aesthetic** was a monthly artscene magazine released by the group Dark Illustrated or often known as DARK. The magazine's obnoxious reviewers rant, critic and score the art pieces put out by the community, even though scores are very subjective. "To reiterate: my grading is based on an equal rating of creativity, originality, and technical execution. Each are worth 1/3 a grade out of ten. In my book, there are three loose arenas that most ANSI can be grouped into; comic rips, non-comic rips, and fonts."

The magazine is edited by [The Green Hornet](https://demozoo.org/sceners/28418/) and [desalvo](46918) who generally leave low scoring reviews and keep the commentary brutal, it is no wonder people avoided this community and it eventually died. For example, "What can I say. X takes the cake as the shittiest artist in the scene.", and even their own group is not spared, "A low quality pack, both in material and presentation. Dark's worst pack ever".
