Reaction was once misunderstood as part of **Forgive Us Crazy Kids** and called F.U.C.K. Console. However, the use of the name and acronym was unauthorized and knowingly stolen. After threats from the original group, the 1994 interlopers [agreed](/f/ad1ccb5) to rename themselves under the umbrella of **Blood, Guts an' Disorder** or BGD, and **Reaction** became the console division.
