**`DEMOS.TXT`** is an untitled[^1] publication written by [dmw](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46121/) that has reviewed over 400 demos, cracktros and intros on the PC!

"The "subjective" ratings consist of three scores on a 0-10 scale and an overall score which is a combination of the three scores. Keep in mind that this (the ratings) is "ONE" persons opinion of the demos AND, many demos were reviewed previous to other GREAT demos thus the reason for
some deviation in the scores given. By all means don't take any bad ratings of your demos personally."

The earliest review is [RAX](/f/ac21460) from 1987 which scores a 3 and the best review is [Second Reality](/f/a61b5a4) which scores a perfect 10.
