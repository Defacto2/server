**TFW** described itself as a weekly game review and is very Scene focused. Reviews included the release's `FILE_ID.DIZ`, system requirements, and scores with commentary for playability, ingenuity, graphics + sound, gameplay, and an overall score.

Reviews were written by Q-Ball and CyberPhreak, and the reviews ended up in [Reality Check Network](/g/reality-check-network).
