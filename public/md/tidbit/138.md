The name Oblivion appears in `OBLIVION.COM` that's dated from June 1990. In it contains "Brought to you buy: OBLIVION. A week ahead of the rest!", suggesting a courier group? Two unknown boards are also mentioned, Faster Than Liight and The Overseer.

In 1998 a little known German cracking or training group commissioned two "Oblivion" cracktros that were programmed by [Crusher](https://demozoo.org/sceners/122935/) from Berlin.
