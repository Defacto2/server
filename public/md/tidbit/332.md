**The Ware Report!** or Ware Report was a Scene game group chart by [The Renegade Chemist](https://demozoo.org/sceners/25805/) that scored the releases of the month and summarize the group's performance with lots of inside baseball. "The release's point rating, based on major-ness of the release publisher, platform, etc." As a leader of [Eclipse](/g/eclipse) and later in [Prestige](/g/prestige), he would freely admit to bias in the scoring, "Really Biased Commentary."

Our first issue is from April 1995, but there were earlier lost issues, with the issue opening with, "Argh! Its back! The April '95 Ware Report, by The Renegade Chemist".
