The Grand Council were a Michigan (+313) based cracking group that released games during 1988 and 1989, often with the tag line "Another fine Grand Council Crack".

In 1988 the following members were often listed:

 - "Slippery Jim" diGriz who was the primary cracker for the group.
 - Doctor Crobe, General Zennor, Crazy Sid Barret, Barc

However, in multiple 1989 releases, only Slippery Jim gets credited.
