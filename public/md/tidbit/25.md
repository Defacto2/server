Future Crew was the most famous demoscene group on the PC in the 1990s. 
The PC was primarily a business platform and games or multimedia were always secondary. 
But early demos by the Future Crew helped to change the mindset some, that the PC wasn't only for productivity and would become the platform of the future for general computing, gaming and multimedia.

The founding information on the Future Crew has been muddled over the years by incorrect and conflicting dates put out by the group themselves in different documents. Their first release, **GR8** came out in July 1989 and their second **Yo!** sometime in 1990.

Their first big release is [U N R E A L](/f/b32bc68) from mid-1992, and that got followed up with [Panic](/f/a71ff6c) at the end of the year.
However, it was 1993's [Second Reality](/f/a61b5a4) that propelled the group into the mainstream, at least with online computer users and the technology press.
By December, id Software published the shareware edition of Doom. 
With both products being posted online within months of each other, for the first time, they helped cemented the PC as the dominate computer game and demo platform.
