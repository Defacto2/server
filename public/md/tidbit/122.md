**Club El√°n** were a cracking group from 1990 and 1991. And it is possible it consisted of only two members, the crackers [Aiwatts](/p/aiwatts), [JEFF](/p/jeff). Aiwatts was also a member of the Apple group [East Coast Connection](/g/east-coast-connection) that also shared the same home board, [The Outer Limits 2](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12271/) from New York City.
