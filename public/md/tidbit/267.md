**BEER** or "BTW's Excellent E-Rag" is a magazine by BTW or Bizarre Types of Wares with a single known issue from September 1994. It was intended to be a quarterly newsletter for BTW.

It's hard to find what the magazine or the group was about, however the Group Reviews section is more of a drama section:

- TPU or [The People Upstairs](https://demozoo.org/groups/79163/) was a new group and their first release Elite Acro List v1.0, but the article's author tested it and wasn't impressed.
- [PE](https://demozoo.org/groups/53703/) and [MAD](https://demozoo.org/groups/78478/) recently merged to form _The FiRM Inc._, but the author suggests they could have used an original name.
- The author didn't like the annoymous writer "2 Elite 4 U" bashing [SWaT](https://demozoo.org/groups/46345/).
