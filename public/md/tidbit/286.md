**N.S.D.A.P.** is a magazine from Hungary but loads as an annoying simulated BBS session that requires you to create a pretend user account to access the articles. It was programmed and edited by Poko and Atya.

Some articles include:
- Game solutions for ten different games
- A (unauthorized) reprint of "DOSREF" - Programmer's Technical Reference Manual for MSDOS and the IBM PC
- Manuals and docs for Elite Frontier and Settlers
