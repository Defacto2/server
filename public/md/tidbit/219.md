**This World Elite BBS list** is a large list of international "elite" boards from May 1992. The text logo seems to read as "The Blacklist" "Your key to the would of the unknown".

Both Amiga and PC boards are listed in a table format, sorted alphabetically and grouped by country. The columns are untitled, but in order list: the board name, the country area code and phone number, the board's primary group affiliation, the primary system operator.
