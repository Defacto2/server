American Pirate Industries from California, was an early example of an electronic magazine for the "elite" PC BBS Scene.

The first issue came out in July 1989, in which Mind Shadow wrote "API is not like your regular group that cracks games and joins sysops of boards. We may have a branch that will perform these duties, but as of right now, our main goal is to INFORM the pirate world of new games, when their coming out, our own personal opinion of the game, clues to games, the docs to the game, some fixes for the game, and any other important issues that may come up. You may make the analogy of a newspaper to us."

Members included, Laughing Gas, Mind Shadow, Sturm Brightblade, piro, Missing Link, Black Sabbath and the famous trainer maker [Rescue Raider](/p/rescue-raider). By January 1990, there were over a dozen boards in the [API network](/f/ad25f7e).
