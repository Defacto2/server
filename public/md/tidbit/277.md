**DREADLoC** was a pet project, _HOOPTiE's Politically Correct ANSiZine_. Based in the 915 area code (Western Texas), he would write many of the articles but the magazine would feature guess writers in the issues. Also included were reviews both of artworks and of game titles.

Issue 3 saw a complete rewrite of the magazine's code, which required a painful installation process before reading. Like many Scene products of the time, asthetics became more important than usability. Even the readme is a red flag, "If DREADLoC crashes or there is an error, please make sure to reset your computer. Unfortunately, this version CAN be a bit volitile". The issue 4 readme starts with, "Since no one liked my installation program, here is some help to install", and so required manual installation of the magazine. ðŸ¤¨
