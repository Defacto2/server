ROM 1911 was founded by The Renegade Chemist and Zeus as a dumping ground for PC CD titles that were becoming common place in 1994. At the time Razor 1911 had always been a cracking group that removed (floppy) disk copy protection and the newer CD titles were out of its scope. Zeus had joined Razor in August with the supply of [Doom 2](/f/b31a533) and possibly had fast access to PC CD titles that were looking for release. The first iteration of the group was presented as _ROM 1911 : Razor 1911 CD-ROM Division_.

It is assumed the group died when The Renegade Chemist had [quit](/f/ab3a82) Razor at the end of January 1995. However, months later it was [restarted](/f/a839dd) as <em>ROM 1911</em> by Malicious Intent as another small, three member, one board group.  The group ballooned though and in late July, Malicious Intent [wound it up](/f/aa3e2d), and in annoyance with the Razor leadership, quit to start a new group known as RETRiBUTiON.
