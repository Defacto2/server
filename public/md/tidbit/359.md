Two known groups used the brand Sneakers. The first is relatively unknown, which used the initialism **SKS** and was probably from Germany. There's [one release](/f/ac1a7bc) known today, and that's for an intro with a nfo text for the serial number for the shareware DOS Physics utility application `physik.exe`.

In 1993, a PC release group known as Sneakers had only one known [release](/f/ab2d4f) for an educational game supplied by Fallen Angel. It advertises two Canadian BBSes, Twins from Montreal and the Toronto-based [Terrordome](/g/terrordome-bbs).

Sneakers, aka **SNK**, is best known as a console release group; however, there could be a link between the 1993 PC group and the console. A 1995 [screen capture](/f/ab2d4f) of the Sneakers restricted message forum at their Canadian HQ, [Beyond Akira](/g/beyond-akira-bbs), reveals a user by the name of Fallen Angel with access, the same nick found in the 1993 Canadian PC release. Fallen Angel is also found in the 1997 [releases](/f/b72b512) for the console group.
