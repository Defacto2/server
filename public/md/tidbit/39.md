**Silicon Dream Artists** (SdA) was formed after the merging of Masters of Abstractions and Illusions (MAi) and Maximized ANSi Designers (MaD) on 15 November 1991.

[Issue 5](/f/b22a2d4) of the SDA Review from December 1991 has the article "The MAi & MaD Merge" where they write, "SdA stands for Silicon Dream Artists. The group was formed off a ANSi\VGA Group and a Magazine Group."
It goes on to state that MaD "is known for two mergers", one with a Canadian ANSI\VGA art group named FEAR. 
The other group was named EViL, which specialised in VGA artworks and VGA loaders.

After the group renamed themselves to GRiM in June 1992, [an artpack](/f/ae1a52a) of the combined releases of SDA and MaD was compiled and released, possibly in early 1993.
