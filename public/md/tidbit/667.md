**RPM** was an early art group from 1991 that placed a strong emphasis on PC VGA animations and cracktros. 
Accordingly, the famous group, ANSi Creators in Demand, took note and proposed a merger that would see the combined group become known as ACiD Productions.

The September [Issue 10](/f/9e595) of The SCD Report has "The History of RPM", and mentions the president was Honus Wagner, and the vice president was KiSaNtH. 
In [issue 12](/f/a04ed) from November, the article "ANSI Wars" by The Eel comments on the merger describing it as shocking, seeing RPM was a quality group.
