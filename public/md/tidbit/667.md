**RPM** was an early art group from 1991 that placed a strong emphasis on PC VGA animations and cracktros. 
Accordingly, the famous group, ANSi Creators in Demand, took note and proposed a merger that would see the combined group become known as ACiD Productions. Force Ten wrote that it was in early November 1991 that ACiD absorbed the best VGA artists of RPM, and later, the remainder of the group joined.

The September [Issue 10](/f/9e595) of The SCD Report has "The History of RPM", and mentions the president was Honus Wagner, and the vice president was KiSaNtH. 
In [issue 12](/f/a04ed) from November, the article "ANSI Wars" by The Eel comments on the merger describing it as shocking, seeing RPM was a quality group.
