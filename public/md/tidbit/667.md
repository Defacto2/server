ACiD's April 1992, **The Acquisition** series of artpacks was probably the first to be released regularly, with updates following each month. 
And while ANSi Creators in Demand began exclusively releasing text art. 
Following the trend of multimedia PCs, they transitioned to digital "VGA art" images and other media, and reflecting this, they renamed themselves to **ACiD Productions**. 
However, it wasn't too long before the World Wide Web would take over the online communities, and artists would ditch ANSI text art altogether, mirroring the widespread trend of deserting computerized bulletin boards for the Internet.

ACiD would go on to release thousands of artworks seen in an endless number of artpack releases, plus found numerous group subdivisions, and would sometimes disappear only to return later on. 
However, the last release on New Year's Day, 2004: [ACiD-100](https://16colo.rs/archive/2004/acid-100.zip), _ACiD Acquisition 100: the final artpack_, saw the end of the brand after 13-plus years.
