**The Reservoir Warez Report** opened with "The Reservoir Dogs are proud to present 'The Warez Report'. Rating all the game groups in the scene."

Groups would be scored by releases, tallied up to give an overall score, and their performance would be summarized. Issues would also have a highlight and goofs.
