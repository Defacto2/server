In the early and mid-1980s it wasnâ€™t uncommon for PC boards and pirate forums to host game documentation that were typed out by pirates for the Apple II and Commodore 64 8-bit microcomputers. Many computer games from the USA in this era were first developed on the Commodore or Apple machines and only later, ported to the IBM PC and compatible computers. Sometimes it would take publishers months or even a year or two to release a PC port. So instead of retyping the documents from the game box, PC pirates often got lazy and simply re-shared the texts already created for other platforms.
