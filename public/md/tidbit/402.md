SKiLL was a spin-off group for [iCE Advertisements](/insane-creators-enterprise) that got [announced](/f/b730603) in December 1993. Named “SKiLL/iCE TRIAL”, it was to replace the former _iCE TRIAL_ tag usage for aspiring artists. However, it proved unpopular and the concept was discontinued the following month. “Everyone felt that it was too much of a separate group, so now the SKiLL name is gone”.

In the [SKiLL Newsletter](/f/b12a747), Devil's Spawn wrote, "I was finding good talent out there that had potential to join iCE, but weren't quite iCE quality... so, I decided I'd run a group that would be an "iCE Training Camp" so to speak... so I started with me being to only member back in November".

In the January [art pack](/f/b027eb7) it was boldly announced that SKiLL no longer exists, and the group had renamed to **BARQ!**.
