Most of 1991 would see TRSi working with the PC in a group collaboration. Initially with Public Enemy and the Swedish based The Dream Team together. But then exclusively with TDT under a TDT / TRSi brand that often got referred to as The Cooperation or the coop. That was until September when it was publicly [announced by TDT](/f/af2c09f) that this cooperation “is now broken”. And within a month, TDT were opting to instead co-release with fellow Europeans, Skid Row.
