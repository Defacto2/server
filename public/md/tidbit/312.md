**BAUD**, _(B)BS (A)nd (U)ser's (D)igest_ is a text magazine for the console Scene by `r/\\/e` ([rave](https://demozoo.org/sceners/117460/)) which stated, it is "reviewing console BBS', sysops and users all across the world". Rave writes (ed: modified for clarity), "Back in 1987-88 there was a Commodore 64 text magazine called [INFLUX](https://demozoo.org/groups/130562/) that was run by [Candyman](https://demozoo.org/sceners/7422/)[^1] and a few other guys like Jazzy. For those who don't know it Jazzy[^2] is now `r/\\/e` and 10 years in the scene has taught me alot. Since my first bbs THE CURE to my current system[^3] I have been a dedicated member of the pirating scene."

The "Bulletin Board Report" reviews [Sigma-Seven](https://demozoo.org/sceners/21357/)'s [Synergy](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3237/) BBS in Germany.

The guest "Sysop Report" is [Breakdown](https://demozoo.org/sceners/90470/) operator of [Totally Nuked](https://demozoo.org/bbs/2219/) from Michigan.

"Bye Bye Ghetto" talks about [Andeveron](https://demozoo.org/sceners/78507/) winding down [The Ghetto](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1150/) (510) after being busted by Sega.

"Phreaking, a thing of the past?" talks about the decline of long distance BBSing due to the blacklisting by various phone companies of international phone numbers to popular BBSes. "With both my nodes being blacklisted there is a problem for euros (ed: Europeans) to reach the system. This is yet another plague on the scene. Several boards have either 1 or all nodes blacklisted at this time and it seems that there is little solution to this problem. So it seems that the BBS scene is suffering all over."
