Future Brains Inc. were a Dutch PC group, active in Europe from at least October 1988. They get credited with producing the **first cracktros on the PC** with the earliest example known being an anonymous, animated scroller using an EGA graphics mode that is found in the April 1989 release of [Lombard RAC Rally](/f/b83fd7). Interestingly, the cracktro has a different animation if viewed using the older, less capable, CGA graphics mode. 

Some of their releases would be "imported" to the USA by various individuals and groups, including FBI of America, and [The Humble Guys](/g/the-humble-guys).
