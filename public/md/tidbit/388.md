The Phoney Coders were a trainer group lead by Phoenix from Norway. 
While there were a large number of couriers and distribution sites, but only one game hacker. In September 1992 Phoenix [wrote](/f/b62c7bf), "I'm not happy with the situation. We'll try to build more divisions around the globe to keep it up. It's extremely difficult to run a trainer-group from Norway alone."

In April 1993, iCE Advertisements [announced](/f/b62bc5b) that The Phoney Coders had joined the group. "Among our first acquisitions of talent, the three uzi-wielding Isrealies from the group The Phoney Coders have joined iCE in what has proved to be a most beneficial move for us. Ford Prefect, Mr. Bug, and Codesafe Hawk all bring along extensive talent in the coding arena."
