The Copyright Infiltration Agency or **-CIA-** was a documenation release group or brand from 1988. We only know of one writter, [The Huntsman](/p/the-huntsman), who is likely the system operator of [The Hunting Grounds](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7695/) BBS from (+416) Toronto. In the Double Dragon [documenation](/f/ba271a2) he writes, "If you have any have any questions, you can find me on any 416 pirate board."

I would have to image -CIA- would have often been confused with Live Wire's cracking group, [CIA](/g/crackers-in-action)  (Crackers In Action).
