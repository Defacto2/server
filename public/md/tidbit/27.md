**V O R T E X Software** were a cracking group from 1987 who in their release of 3D Helicopter Simulator write, "We like to think of ourselves as the "Hidden" pirates, because we don't suffocate our cracks with our names and gaudy splash title screens."

Names mentioned in the releases we have are: Magnus Greel of [Fone ConsPiracy BBS](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12532/) from Minneapolis and Dee Bugg, who both supplied. Plus The Aptolcater and Mr Bill who worked on the release for Ultima 4.
