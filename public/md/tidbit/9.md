The A.S.P. was a group that specialised in writing original and also resharing **UNPROTECT** text instructions for PC applications and later games. These instructions were used to bypass disk copy protection and were shared on legitimate BBSes, Compuserve, and elite pirate boards.  In the day, these types of instructions were perfectly legal and their use encouraged by many.

Often these unprotect instructions were submitted to a few affiliate ASP boards including:

- ASA Fulton's, Shining Sun BBS (+305, Miami)
- Whit Wyant’s, PC-Connect BBS (+203, Connecticut)
- Lee Nelson’s, PC-Forum BBS (+404, Atlanta)
