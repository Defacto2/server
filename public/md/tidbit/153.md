There are a confusing number of brands and groups for The Syndicate.

A group from 1990 that listed themselves as both The Syndicate and The $yndicate Presents cracked games and comprised of five members, MotorCity Madman, Sid Bartlett, The Central Scrutinizer, Cosmo McKinley-Rushmore. We only have two releases, [Stunts](/f/a724a40) and [Operation Stealth](/f/b221c16), and no members turn up in any other groups.

The other, longer lived group from 1990, branded themselves both as The Syndicate!, The \<yndicate, The \$yndicate, and \$ynd. They began with three members, group president Pumpin Pete, Pig Killer, Ninja and operated from The [Chicago Transfer Authority (CTA)](https://demozoo.org/bbs/10139/) board. With other boards, [Pirates Cove](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12043/), and Pig Killer's [Give me Liberty](https://demozoo.org/bbs/5289/). They are unusual, as they started releasing applications such as operating systems but transitioned to cracking games.

[By October 1991](/f/be2e7ce), the membership switched to Canseco, Paradox, Pig Killer, Star Gazer, and Paradox's board [Top Speed Reaction](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12272) was the base of operations. However, the next month this also included, Quick Silver, The Magnet, and Ronnieman system operator of [The Forge](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12270/). The group continued into 1994 with Canseco of Give Me Liberty being the constant member.
