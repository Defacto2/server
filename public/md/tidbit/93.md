Black Star Productions or **B\*P** is probably named after [Black Star](/p/black-star) from Atlanta and the system operator of [Byte Bandits](https://demozoo.org/bbs/8908/) and [Revo Emag](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12178/) BBS. In August of 1989, Black Star joined The UnderGround Council and in his [first release](/f/ab2c196), announced the opening of his new board, Byte Bandits.

The one release we have from B*P was written by [Donverco](/p/donverco) and two boards were listed, First World BBS and Revo Emag BBS.
