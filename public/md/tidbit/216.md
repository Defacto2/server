The **Uncut Ware Report** was a monthly statistics magazine for the PC game release Scene with only one known issue covering the month of August 1992.

The scoring would be calculated per group by the total sizes and number of titles released. However, only PC floppy disk games in English were counted.

The top three groups for August were: The Dream Team and Fairlight tied for first and Razor 1911 in third.
