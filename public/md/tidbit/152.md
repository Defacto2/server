**TWA** as **The Warez Alliance** started out in late 1990 as a New York based cracking group on [The Realm of Heroes](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7719/) with former members of [Classic VOCs](/g/classic-vocs) and [Disassemblers of America](/g/disassemblers-of-america).

The primary cracker for 1990 was Vigilante, then in 1991 [The Mad Scientist](/p/the-mad-scientist) of [NYC](/g/new-york-crackers) joined. But Wildcat of [NEUA](/g/national-elite-underground-alliance) also occasionally helped, "although I am a NEUA cracker, this game was given to me by the TWA people so I cracked it for them".

Other members included, Byte, Shadow Demon, Buccaneer, Motion Lotion, WardeN, Melkor, Amplitude, Con Artist, Evil Avenger, The Mad Scientist, The Fang, Mak Attack, The Warden.
