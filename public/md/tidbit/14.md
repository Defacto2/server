Silicon Valley Swappe Shoppe looks to be the personal brand used by **Mr. Turbo** who sometimes signed as *MT*. Having appeared as a PC cracking group in 1986 and then years later in 1992-93 as a console group releasing documentation for hardware hacking the two major gaming platforms of the time, the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis.

Given the scope of the years and subject matter, there are probably many other releases by Mr. Turbo and the Swappe Shoppe that maybe lost.
