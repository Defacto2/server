It is likely DNA went through a number of iterations, however **Opus Outland** seems to be the continuous member throughout the years.

The first time DNA appears is in an [ANSI screen](/f/ad1c16e) drawn by [Opus Outland](https://16colo.rs/artist/opus%20outland) while being member of [Aces of ANSI Art](/g/aces-of-ansi-art) in 1990. In it, DNA stood for "**DIGITAL NOISE! ALLIANCE**".

The second appearance was in a cheat created by Opus Outland for the game [Corporation](/f/a41d52e) in August 1991. In it, he affiliates himself as a member of [**DnA**] and greets both its members and sites.

Finally, a [member and site list](/f/b32f996) appears in January 1992, which reveals the group is now creating [ScreamTracker](https://modland.com/pub/documents/format_documentation/Scream%20Tracker%20v1.0%20(.stm).txt) digital music. The home board is [The Devil's Realm](https://demozoo.org/bbs/8977/) in Santa Clara, California.
