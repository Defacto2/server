This is a Scene report that reviews the top 5 groups for the month. The questionable title is nod to an early Internet meme started by Shadow Master that was popular in the piracy Scene in this era. The Punisher leader of Razor 1911 spoke about this in Affinity [issue 8](/f/a414d), "Well, SMaster and Prestige basically started the Paki trend. And since it is a great group with many followers, I guess the trend spread."

Authors, Shadow Master of [Prestige](/g/prestige) and MindBender was of [Hybrid](/g/hybrid). So naturally both groups are reviewed in the report, along with [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911), [Paradigm](/g/paradigm), and [Reflux](/g/reflux). But it is not a surprise that both Prestige and Hybrid take the top positions in both issues.
