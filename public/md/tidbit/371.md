**The Flaming Arrows** were a demo and cracking (or cracking adjacent) group on the Commodore Amiga. Based in the Netherlands, the group on that platform ran from 1988 and lasted around eight years. Thankfully, [a mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20000829080106/http://www.euronet.nl/users/jdm/documents/members.html) of their old website survives, and suggests by 1997, the group was inactive or had moved to the PC.

On the PC, they operated as an Internet warez courier group from at least 1998, and by the following year, they had three loose divisions. 

- TFA, "0sec Couriering"
- TFAiSO, ISO, and VCD (video) releasing couriering.
- TFaMP - MP3 (audio) releasing and couriering.

The last NFO text file we have from mid-2001 reveals the creation of a new online TFAServices division for website maintenance and the return of TFAAmiga, dealing with demo and assembler programming on that platform.
