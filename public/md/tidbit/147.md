West Coast Cracking Production or **WCCP** was a small cracking group, probably based in California.

Its two members, TCK and Mr. Potato were also the group's system operators for the boards, [The Crypt](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12734/) and [The Republic](https://demozoo.org/bbs/12733/) in San Diego.
