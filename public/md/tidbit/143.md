**PETRA**'s first [release](/f/ae2a926) was Battle of Rommelus that came out on the 14th January 1990. The group was founded by Sub Zero and Vigilanti, both former members of [INC](/g/international-network-of-crackers). In the `READ.ME` they go on to say, "We then joined with Oxidizer who also was an INC person. Then I talked to people around the Chicago area getting crackers. Right now we have 4. Patcheye Knight (former INC cracker), Deathwish, Psychic Vacuum, and Lord Chaos." "PETRA was also formed because INC has been coming out with some bad cracks".

Its crackers were Patcheye Knight, Deathwish, Psychic Vacuum, and Lord Chaos.
