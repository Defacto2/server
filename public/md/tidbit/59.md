Sorcerers were a Finnish group of teenage programmers who created some of the earliest demos on the PC. 
However, this happened in mid-1989, and was a long time after the intros and demos kicked off on other microcomputers in 1986 and 1987.
Despite the newness, the Sorcerer's Summer Holiday looks primitive compared to demos released years earlier on the Commodore and Atari machines,
and this is due to the awfulness of programming the PC at the time.
