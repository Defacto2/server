**ASC** is an unknown initialism for a little known cracking group from 1989.
In the release of Speedball, Death Jester aka Htaed writes, "I like to thank Blackthrone, Apple Assassin, Black Lord, and Oingo Boingo for keeping ASC alive." Another group under the name of **Association of Software Conspiracy** released games in late 1993 and 1994. It is assumed to be these two are the same due to the member "Htaed" being present in both groups.

Known members of the 1993-94 group were Htaed, Data Fluxx, The Mask, Mystic Lord, and Dr. Video.

And a list of boards included: [The Mute City](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3734/)[^1], The Unknown II, [Southside BBS](https://demozoo.org/bbs/6489/), [Highway to Hell](https://demozoo.org/bbs/10459/)[^1], The Chronic.

Interestingly, the February 1994 release of PlanIt includes [an apology](/f/ae27d34) which highlights conflict the BBS community had with large CD ROM release. "I'd like to apologized about the CyberRace CD-ROM release of ours. You can't blame me for wanting to get the stuff out to you guys. Take a look at Razor 1911's Comanche 'Enhanced' (thinly veiled CD-ROM version), Romkid's Interplay's [10th Anniversary collection](/f/af2605a) (CD-ROM only), and Mad Dog McCree (CD only). At least we told it like it was. It's a fuckin' CD-ROM game. CyberRace was a little too big but no where close to the 650 Megs if we were to release Gabriel Knights[^2] CD-ROM."

[^1]: Both boards were based on Los Angeles County, which may suggest ASC was from LA.
[^2]: [Gabriel Knight](https://www.gog.com/en/game/gabriel_knight_sins_of_the_fathers_20th_anniversary_edition): Sins of the Fathers was a famed adventure game that first released as a "Multimedia CD Edition" in a very stylized [retail box](https://www.mobygames.com/game/116/gabriel-knight-sins-of-the-fathers/cover/group-2090/cover-957/).
