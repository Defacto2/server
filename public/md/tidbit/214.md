Scene Rift by [Psibelius](https://demozoo.org/sceners/19700/) is an article about the tribalism of the creative Scene. He writes, "the rift that seems to be getting bigger between members of the artscene (or ansi scene) and the denizens of the demo/music scene." "ACiD has had some members attend demoparties and enter in the music and graphics competitions. The differences have come between demoscene members appalled and irritated at the intruding presence of an artscene group into their territory" "and ACiD members frustrated by being labeled 'lamers' just because they are members of the group... what many demo/music sceners consider, a 'lame' scene".
