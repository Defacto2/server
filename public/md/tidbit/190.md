**APEX** were a North American courier group from 1992 that published the one-off newsletter that was edited by [Tarl Cabot](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46680/).

While the newsletter mostly contained internal APEX information and advertising, it did include a few Scene articles. Including the announcement of [MAGE](https://demozoo.org/groups/131371/) (Master Artists Guild for the Elite) and the intent to create "The Apex Ware Report" inspired by Byter's [previous effort](/g/the-ware-report).
