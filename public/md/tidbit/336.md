**Affinity E-Zine** (AFT) was a magazine originally publish by Canadian Born Coders (CBD) before becoming a brand onto itself. It was one of the big publications of the period and unlike most other magazines, Affinity would have their own in-house game reviews. In some repsects, Affinity were ahead of time, covering subjects that would blow up online years later. Such as the day one birth of MP3 piracy that would go mainstream with Napster, or the extensive coverage of Damage Cybernetics during their two peak, exploring console emulation long before retro gaming blew up on YouTube.

The [first issue](/f/a6150) came out in 26th July 1996, meaning it came out in between the far more popular Reality Check Network issues 23 and 24, and in the forward they write, "We would like to thank RCN for giving us the Inspiration to publish our own magazine." It was programmed in Borland C++ by Mr Mister and edited by Mr Mister and Super Hacker.

Interviews were conducted with Scorpian of Premiere that was founded around 1st of June, Bug Lord a co-founder of EPiC, Druidkin the Net Director of the [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911), Speedball of RiSE, Charley of Cell Block 4 who didn't like her previous interview in RCN together with IvanHoe and they talk about the history of the group, Shadow Master talks of the SPA.

[Issue 3](/f/a817c) rebrands itself as Affinty Electronic Magazine with the tagline "Your alternative warez magazine". Interviews include Rio and Ken of Razor 1911/Mortality/EverClear, Tok of Sodom, Phalycide of Empire, Charley returns for a second interview, Demoltion president Violator.

There is also a spotlight on Compress 'da Audio, the first music piracy group on the Scene and probably on the Internet. Affinity interviews NetFrack, the founder who talks about the concept. "Well, I've thought of the idea of somehow pirating, music. However I never had the means to do so, until now." "We eliminated the size constraints. We use a new format to compress our music. The MP3 format." Their first release was Until it Sleeps by Metallica and first shared online on the 10th of August 1996.

[Issue 4](/f/a9176) spotlights GLOW or the Gorgeous Ladies of Warez and interviews co-founder Kimberlee (Lady_C) who states, "We decided that there was a great amount of female talent that was dispersed throught the net lacking some type of unification and thought that perhaps if we brought it all together... that maybe we could have ladies make their make in the scene"

Interviews include Entropy of Core Dump, ShereKhan of the MP3 group Digital Audio Crew, RATM formerly of RCN, and RipTide's magazine [CyberMail](/g/cybermail) briefly joins the Affinity.

[Issue 5](/f/aa108) sees a new interface and begins with seperate interviews with Y0shi and The_Brain of Damaged Cybernetics, who were some of the pioneers in console emulation, N0Fx and BonethuG of the MP3 group Rabid Neurosis, SuperChic the other co-founder of GLOW mention they're at 38 members, and the spotlight is with Mack Crack Corporation (MCC) and interviews Pyschotrn.

[Issue 6](/f/a21a1) opens with a drama on a BBS that has been lost to time, and interviews Wildd the vice president of SiN and Shiffie of PWA, and the spotlight is an interview with Nemesis senior Con-Man who started out in Malice and Fairlight "about 6 or so years ago".  A novel feature is introduced, "Old NFOs" which we at this website give a nod to.

[Issue 7](/f/a31bb) sees co-editor Dante retire and replaced with RedNex. There are two more interviews with the crew of Damaged Cybernetics, Typhoon_z and EFX. The cover story is an interview with t800 who talks about the fall of Lightning Couriers. Interviews include Zima Man the president of Pinnacle, BiG_W talks about the UK Scene. And the spotlight is with _HappIS_ the Defiance leader.

[Issue 8](/f/a414d) is a bumper issue and focuses on the retirement of The Speed Racer from Razor 1911, being replaced by The Punisher. We get individual interviews with TSR himself, The Punisher, and Toast. The Punisher is the most interesting and he talks of his dislike of Scene magazines, a feeling that would spread. "Magazines reveal scene happenings that 'could' benefit law agencies. For example, David Amore from EA reads RCN and INQ whenever he can to learn what's going on".

Damage Cybernetics members are interviewed, MindRape the group founder who started it in 1991 plus Yoshi and Riff also return to talk of quickNES. When asked about why DC is a major player in consoles MindRape states, "we all have (ed: console) copiers. The truth is this. Consoles are much more fun than the PC Warez scene and other scenes. It is more based on the C64 scene than anything, the attitudes, the friendships and fun!"

The Damage Cybernetics website at the time was at `http://www.futureone.com/~damaged` but got [shutdown](https://web.archive.org/web/19990128133052/http://futureone.com/%7Edamaged/real.htm) on the 4th April 1997, two years after going online.
