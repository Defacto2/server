TOXiCShock was a brief piracy and phreak magazine from the Melbourne, Australia BBS network, Southern Pirates Independent Network. The program was built without approval using the leaked source code of [Illuminatus](/g/illuminatus). Note that this magazine is buggy.

Only one issue got released in August 1991 with the following articles: A reprint of the [International Network of Crackers](/g/international-network-of-crackers) newsletter #1 from September 1989 including the founding of the group. Melbourne Piracy and +61-3 board reviews.
