**-TOP-** or **Tired of Protection** were small cracking group from Virginia, but over the years had boards throughout North America. Its founder and cracker was The Mage! while the other consistent cracker was Majik. The home board was always [The Mage's Lair](https://demozoo.org/bbs/7591/) and as the name suggests, it was operated by The Mage.

The group would release a number of Computer Health Compendiums that were collections of Unprotects for various game titles. With the February 1991 [Compendium](f/b02ddd0) having fixes for almost 30 titles. And later the group would venture into documentation and applications.
