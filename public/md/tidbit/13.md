Despite the name, ESP Pirates looks to be a brand used by the cracker [Mr. Peace](/p/mr-peace) for his own releases and cracks. Maybe the use of a group was aspirational, but there is no evidence of anyone else associated with ESP Pirates.

From 1987, Mr Peace would use his cracks and software to advertise his BBS, [ESP HeadQuarters](/g/esp-headquarters-bbs) (+602) based in Phoenix. And a number of older ESP releases would be repackaged with the board’s phone number and shared around. In the October 1988 walk-through of Kings Quest 4 written by [Lord Zombie](/p/lord-zombie), the ESP HeadQuarters ad lists system operators as Mr. Peace, Party Animal and Lord Zombie. It would be Lord Zombie’s name, in 1990 that would be often seen in releases by [The Humble Guys](/g/the-humble-guys).

By 1989, the BBS, the group and Mr. Peace seem to have vanished.
