ROI Production went by a few names such as Bladewarez Inc., WaREZ/ROI Productions, -=WaREZ/ROI=-, but they were the brands used by the board[^1] The [WaREZ HouZE Super System](/g/warez-houze-bbs) (+413) operated by [The Blademan](/p/the-blademan) in Massachusetts. Releases mostly focused on business applications and utilities, but for a time there were packs of games, cracks, and documentation.

The Blademan is also credited with releasing some of the [earliest](/f/b51f2a2) CD RIPS, Stellar 7 and Mixed Up Mother Goose both on 16th March 1992. Just two weeks after INC's release of [Battle Chess MPC](/f/aa209be) release. These types of releases were not popular though, as they took days to download. And the hard drive space needed was so expensive, it was more cost effective in the long run to buy a CD-ROM drive and the original games. Plus, often, all that the CD editions of games added were cutscenes that would be watched a few times, then skipped.
