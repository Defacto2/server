**The Week in Warez Newsletter** or WWN was a weekly PC piracy Scene magazine first published in July 1995. It's [first issue](/f/a616b) introduction includes, "I decided to start WWN because unlike the Music and Demo scene, the Warez scene had no newsletter or disk mag put out on a regular basis."

Confusingly, the first issue is edited by [Bishop](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149305/) of [Pinnacle](/g/pinnacle)/[RTS](/g/request-to-send), however there is also the columnist [Bish0p](https://demozoo.org/sceners/115025/) of "HtC.RAPE.PCY.VDN.TDC.WWN".

BiSH0P of 514 (Quebec) pens , "Internet = Group Wars WHQ?", "4 years ago the Warez Scene was kinda peaceful with leading groups like The Humble Guys, Razor and TRSi leading the scene. But then in the past 2 years, this happens! The entire scene is going downhill. Sysops bitchin at each other, groups killing each other, lame text files, fake releases, etc. Then this damn war came onto the net."

[Issue 2](/f/a717d) has [MikeySoft](https://demozoo.org/sceners/84230/) of [NTA](/g/nokturnal-trading-alliance)/[RiSC](/g/rise-in-superior-couriering) and The Final Frontier BBS writing "The State of the Scene" and an interview with [Jimmy Jamez](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46815/), the founder of Drink or Die ([DOD](/g/drink-or-die)).

[Issue 3](/f/a8177) has the editorial taken over by [Mercury](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149309/) and a new Warez "biased" Report by Jimmy Jamez. There's also an interview with Pirates With Attitudes ([PWA](/g/pirates-with-attitudes)) cofounder [Orion](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46389/). "PWA started 3 years ago, With [BarManager](https://demozoo.org/sceners/44324/) and myself. We were running [INC](/g/international-network-of-crackers) at the time..." And High Density of DOD/Razor pens, "Ok, here are the reasons why [this new DOD release](/f/bb2b71f) is not a dupe of any previous version of Windows 95."

[Issue 4](/f/a9109) introduces [Ionizer](/p/ionizer)'s Game Review. There is an interview with [Rambone](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46396/) of PWA about the merger of PWA/[SCuM](/g/scum) earlier the week.

[Issue 5](/f/a11a6) has commentary on CD-RIPs by Lord of Darkness (LoD), "Why are CD-RIP programs released over and over again? Sometimes they are packaged poorly, sometimes they are missing files, sometimes they are too big and sometimes they don't work properly. What's so difficult? What are these mistakes repeated?" "For example, the Mechwarrior 2 CD release by [OTFW](https://demozoo.org/groups/84664/) required 2 install fixes and 2 hacked EXE files to get it working properly. The [TDU release](/f/ae20f7d) worked perfectly fine. Where's the gap?"

[Vendetta](/g/vendetta)... The Scene's most forgotten group has an interview with Krypton.

[Issue 6](/f/a21b8) sees Mercury retire from the magazine and editorial duties taken over by Cypress of [Pinnacle](/g/pinnacle). And there is an interview with Count Zero, co-founder of Pinnacle.
 
[Prozac](/p/prozac) responds to the question of bad CD-RIPs, "What's so difficult? Time. Time is against groups to get the stuff off the CD, on to the hard drive, ARJ it up, then release it. No time to check it, no time to see if it'll work on other systems."


[Issue 7](/f/a31b2) has an interview with Raptor, senior of PWA but for all intents and purposes is the final issue. Ionizer released an [issue 8](/f/a4144) but it only includes his Ionizer's Game Review. "Well it seems no one is running WWN anymore, so since I will continue writing this game review, THIS IS NOW WWN." However, two spiritual successors for WWN would come in the following month, [**Inquisition**](/g/inquisition) and [**The Naked Truth**](/g/the-naked-truth-magazine).
