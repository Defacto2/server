[DuNE] Release No. 1 came out on the 10th of October 1991 with a copyright by CPÅ¿S Productions[^1]. 
A release in January 1992 is unnumbered.

Dune would sometimes be swapped with **Deadly Underground Network of Elites**.

[^1]: It is likely the long S is meant to be an "elite" replacement for the letter f, and read CPFS not CPSS.
