Aces of ANSI Art is credited as one of the first organized art groups in the elite BBS scene. After becoming disorganized and demotivated, key members in mid-1990 reformed as the ANSi Creators in Demand, and later known as ACiD Productions, the most prolific art group of the era in the North American scene.
