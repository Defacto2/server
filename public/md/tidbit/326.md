**Inquisition** a text magazine for the PC release Scene continued on from [WWN](/g/the-week-in-warez) with [Raptor](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149310/) and [Mercury](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149309/) as the editors.

[Issue 1](/f/a4160) from October 1995 has an interview with [The Speed Racer](/p/the-speed-racer) of [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911).

[Issue 2](/f/a517a) interviews The Snake and Vile about the merger of [ZillionZ](https://demozoo.org/groups/48749/) (ZZ) and NBK (Natural Born Killers?)

[Issue 3](/f/a610c) interviews [Dorian Hawkmoon](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46466/) of [Malice](/g/malice) and [Orion](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46389/) co-founder of Pirates With Attitude ([PWA](/g/pirates-with-attitudes)) on his retirement.

[Issue 4](/f/9e1a5) has [Jimmy Jamez](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46815/) back being interviewed. But the issue mostly covers the recent Scene busts involving [Mikeysoft](https://demozoo.org/sceners/84230/), his [The Final Frontier](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3453/) BBS, and others, that got launched by Novel and Microsoft. "Mikeysoft prompted the public that he was under investigation." "On Tuesday night, October 24, 1995, [The Pieman](https://demozoo.org/sceners/7425/)'s home (ed: of [The Pits](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1364/) BBS) was raided by U.S. Marshals and Representitives of Novel Corporation."

[Issue 5](/f/9f1bf) interviews [Hoson](https://demozoo.org/sceners/16470/) co-founder of [Hybrid](/g/hybrid). He talks about how Hybrid was founded in the winter of 1993 by himself and [LowTec](https://demozoo.org/sceners/130974/) from Germany. That it used to be European group, however after the merger with [Bluewater](https://demozoo.org/sceners/106075/)'s [Dynamix](http://localhost:1323/g/dynamix), it is now loaded with many North Americans. Also is an interview with [Ordnance](https://demozoo.org/sceners/113444/) on the breakup of "Rise To Send", however it is a typo, [RTS](/g/request-to-send) is actually "Request To Send".

[Issue 6](/f/a01b1) was more of a rebuttal issue with an anonymous arguing about the RTS and another article by "Scott" on the recent Scene busts. There's also an interview with [Tsunami](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149314/) selling his new magazine "[Reality Check](/g/reality-check-network)", who unbeknown, would become archive rivals of Inquisition.

[Issue 7](/f/a114b) has a couple of pieces and commentary on the trend by some groups using the Internet to claim the win for a release over more traditional BBSes. 

And there is a great interview with [Insane TMM](https://demozoo.org/sceners/1228/), one of the original three founders of [Razor 1911](/g/razor-1911). "My handle is InsaneTTM, I come from Trondheim Norway. TTM stands for The Tractor Maniac. ;)" "during October 1985 three guys, Myself, [Sector9](https://demozoo.org/sceners/1227/) and [Dr NO](https://demozoo.org/sceners/1229/), decided to get a kewl name." "after a while we soon started to get interested in demos" "on the amiga until 91, we had some 50 releases. Then, the next step was to get into the PC world. At the time we got into the PC, as you said [INC](/g/international-network-of-crackers) and [THg](/g/the-humble-guys) were the leading forces, but after all the years in the business, we had a lot of contacts everywhere and were able to get some real action"

[Issue 8](/f/a215d) has a brief interview with [Orion](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46389/), retired founded of Pirates With Attitude (PWA) and has a small piece by the crew of [TDUJam](/g/tdu_jam) and their retirement, "[The Digital Underground](https://demozoo.org/bbs/2448/) ceases to exist as such as of now."

There's a new section, the top boards based on the number of long distance visitors who call in.

[Issue 9](/f/a3157) leans into drama, first between the [tKLP](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46989/) of [ROR](https://demozoo.org/groups/81464/) and [g0d](https://demozoo.org/sceners/88424/) of [fATE](https://demozoo.org/groups/88422/), and then between Inquisition and Reality Check Network. While [White Cracker](https://demozoo.org/sceners/88476/) writes about the history and why he ended High Tech Couriers ([HtC](https://demozoo.org/groups/78926/)). 

[DruidKin](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46932/), the "Net director" of Razor 1911 doubles down on the use of the Internet for releases. "For a group to be able to win then they must be allowed access to the other's (ed: BBS) WHQ. In cases like Hybrid and Park Central, when we try to upload on multiple accounts, all our people are mysteriously knocked offline." "I've talked with many people from the competion, and they agree that the Internet is the future no matter how much they hate to admit it." "The biggest complaint is that there is no division between lamers and elites. There they are wrong. Lets face it, lamers can't access the cool (ed: Internet) sites like Scumsite, or LA, or Riscsite."

[Issue 10](/f/a4169) has an unauthorized interview with [Ware Maker](https://demozoo.org/sceners/149312/), "Well, as most people have probably heard, on Wednesday the 13th of December Ware Maker of DOD/RZR/RTS was raided and busted."

[Issue 11](/f/a5163) dropped Ionizer's Game Review after a misunderstanding over the status of Inquisition. 

There's a couple of press releases on the busts of [Blackhawk](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46388/), system operator of [Assassins Guild](https://demozoo.org/bbs/1631/) BBS. "The 25-year-old decided he would soon quit offering access to hundreds of pirated software products through his Assassins' Guild Bulletin Board Service, and instead use his 13 computers, 11 modems and satellite dish to start an Internet provider service."

"The Assassin's Guild billed itself as the worldwide headquarters for two large pirate groups,  Pirates with an Attitude (PWA) and Razor 1911. U.S. Marshals raided (ed: name removed) Mr. X' residence last April"

Unusually, there's a number of interviews.
- [Technic](https://demozoo.org/sceners/114272/), a cracker for Pirate's With Attitude (PWA) who says he goes back to the Apple \]\[ days 
- [The Speed Racer](https://demozoo.org/sceners/90523/) of Razor 1911 who talks about contemporary issues, "As far as the floppy scene goes it does look dead."
- Ordnance has a longer interview on Request to Send (RTS)
- [Blitzkrieg-X](https://demozoo.org/sceners/82008/) talks about TDU-Jam

<br>
After issue 11, Inquisition would merge with [**The Naked Truth Magazine**](/g/the-naked-truth-magazine) (NTM) for a few issues. However, after that magazine also faded, Inquisition returned in October with [Issue 12](/f/a6175). It is the final[^3] known issue and there are no interviews, just a few articles plus the usual reviews.

Also of interest is this advert found in issue 11 for one of the earliest hardware hacking websites, [Damaged Cybernetics](https://archaic-ruins.lngn.net/features/damaged/)[^1] that became associated with NESticle[^2].
