According to a history and information file penned by Genesis, **CORP** was founded by him in 1992 as a European group to compete with [iCE](/g/insane-creators-enterprise) and [ACiD](/g/acid-productions). However, after releasing their first art pack collection, they realised it was too difficult with only five artists, and agreed to merge with iCE to become the **iCE European Division**.

After a year of working in collaboration with iCE, Genesis decided to reform the group, mostly because more artists were available for the group, totaling ten. One of the issues he did not like about the art scene in the USA vs Europe was, "the main difference is that people jump from one group to another like if it was the same thing as eating breakfast". Genesis instead wanted CORP to be a team where everybody got along.
