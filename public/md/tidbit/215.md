**TSR** only has a couple of surviving issues. [Lord Logics](https://demozoo.org/sceners/46653/) is the programmer and The Headman is the editor. The magazine suffers from an unintuitive interface that uses both arrows and function keys for navigation. 

[Issue #3](/f/b329042) for April 1992 reviews seven games and unusually two early CD games under "multimedia", Battle Chess and Kings Quest 5 MPC. However, given the use of compact discs, the reviews maybe plagiarized from a print magazine. "Slide the CD into your properly equipped PC and you'll hear the whirling, thunderous storm that sucks the King's castle and family.".

[Issue #4](/f/b42b952) for May 1992 only reviews two games but has dozens of articles on PC industry news. It also has a not-so-obvious PC release statistics page for release groups that can be accessed by pressing the `F10` key.
