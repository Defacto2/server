There seems to be at least four different groups who used the brand **Impact** in 1996 and 1997 that are collected here.

The most famous is probably the console cracking group named Impact who also worked with Superior Art Creations from Germany. We lack any Impact NFO or other group information files so they remain rather anonymous.

There were two PC release groups in 1997 who also used the name Impact. One would use the acronym **PAC** and sometimes identify themselves as "**IMP@CT**". The other would use tag lines such as *iMp Family iNC* and *Impact Family Inc.*.

Finally, there was an artgroup named [Impact](https://demozoo.org/groups/87005/) who were based in Manitoba, Canada.
