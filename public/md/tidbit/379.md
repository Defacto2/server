**NC-17** or Non-Sense Incorporated, was a briefly lived ANSI group that either merged into or was renamed to GRiM. 
Many of the artworks that got published in June and July 1992 using the "\[NC-17\] '92" were updated to use "\[GRiM\] '92" and were added into the [August GRiMOiRE](/f/a619ba8).

For example, there are these two ads for [The Gates of Hell](/g/gates-of-hell-bbs), the one [from 24th July](/f/ab1da36) and the other [from 1 August](/f/b0273ea).
