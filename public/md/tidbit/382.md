**HiPE** was a small ANSI art group that operated from October 1991 until March 1992.
They mostly worked with boards located in the greater Detroit metro area (+313).

There's no listed group structure, but its home board [Violent Illusions](https://demozoo.org/bbs/9214/) was run by SiR EBRaL PalSy and EXiLE.
