**The Warez Loop 1996** was an annual newsletter written by [MindBender](/p/mindbender) who was involved in a lot of other publications. He writes, "This is a compilation of all the warez-reports I released in the year of 1996
plus some extra information on the months I didnt release to get a overview on which group that acctually won the year of 1996..." Each game release group is scored and ranked with commentary by MindBender.

This newsletter went by a few names, The Warez Loop, The Warez Report, and MindBender's Warez Report. In August 1997 he would follow up with **[The Legendary Report](/g/the-legendary-report)**.
