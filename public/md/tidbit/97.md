According to the TSAN [Newsletter #1](/f/a6549), "TCS was a cracking group which started around February of 1991. TCS never had many releases, and folded after April. The problem with TCS was that they had no suppliers and no couriers.". However, this conflicts with the August 1989 release of [Gauntlet II](/f/a722726) by TCS and cracked by [Lord Zombie](/p/lord-zombie)/[Final Frontier](https://demozoo.org/bbs/3453/) BBS of [The Humble Guys](/g/the-humble-guys) fame. Maybe this is a different group?

It goes on to say, "The Crime Syndicate International Network is a network connecting a variety of BBS software systems in an international scope. The current nations participating in the network are: The United States, Australia, and Israel."
