[Buckaroo Banzai](/p/buckaroo-banzai) was a prolific game hacker and trainer maker who was most famous for his 1980s cracking tutorials on the PC and cracks on the Apple II as the [Reset Vector](/sceners/120029/). In his original 1986 publication [Cracking On the IBMpc, Part 1](/f/aa239c0). Buckaroo writes, "For years, I have seen cracking tutorials for the APPLE computers, but never have I seen one for the PC. I have decided to try to write this series to help that pirate move up a level to a crackest."

Years later in the [CRACKING 101 - 1990 edition](/f/b01ce76), he updates the introduction with, "But the road was hard since unlike the apple, there were NO textfiles on cracking the PC. Several unprotects, but nothing that really told you what to do. But thanks to some of the better known crackists of the day (Thanks [SPI](/g/software-pirates-inc) for the help *ed: Software Pirates INC*) I got through. It was at that point I decided to give something back."

The series was revised and republished both as the Ancient Art of Cracking for NUEA and for Buck Naked Productions.
