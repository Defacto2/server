**The Legendary Report** (TLR) was an newsletter written by [MindBender](/p/mindbender) who was involved in a lot of other publications. This was a follow up to **[The Warez Loop 1996](/g/the-warez-loop)** and was released in August 1997. MindBender writes, "There´s been a while since my last warez-report. I guess that after writing my full-year
report of 1996, I lost sense of direction in how to make these reports... Ionizer retired from [TGR](/g/the-game-review) which made it even harder keeping track of what´s out. When I was about to make a comeback on my summer-vaccation, my girlfriend broke up with me. So right now I´m back from the 'shittiest-summer-of-my-life'".
