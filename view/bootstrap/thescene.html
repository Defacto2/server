<p class="lead">Historically, the Scene consisted of communities of computer users engaged in particular activities but often loosely grouped.</p>
<p>
    The loose grouping of Scene activities comes from the era when the Internet was inaccessible to the general public. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board Systems</a> were the principal means for savvy computer users to connect online, communicate and exchange data. 
    To encourage more people to use their services, boards often hosted various computer-specific activities and subjects. 
    It led to online communities engaged in some intertwined topics that evolved, were grouped, and became the Scene.

        Cracking is the art of modifying software for a particular purpose.
        It can vary widely from the simple act of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainer_(games)">creating cheats for video games</a> (trainers) to the removal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection">sophisticated software copy protection</a>.

        In the early days of microcomputing, the removal of copy protection by cracking software was not unlawful. 
        However, this has long since changed, and the sharing of commercial software and media for free is illegal.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">Hacking</a> should not be confused with software cracking, it is the unorthodox manipulation or exploration of most things computer-related.
        Online texts and tools for hacking were often combined with those on phreaking, anarchy, and computer virus creation, using the h/p/a/v classification.
        Today this grouping has fallen out of favor, especially the modern association of <a href="http://textfiles.com/anarchy/">anarchy text files</a> and <a href="http://textfiles.com/virus/">computer viruses</a> that get misconstrued for activities against nation-states.
