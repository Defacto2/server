  You're at the website preserving the <u>historic</u> cracking and "warez" scene subcultures on personal computers. 
  It covers digital artifacts, including text files, demos, music, art, magazines, and other projects. 
  The nature of historical software piracy, with high churn and elusiveness, 
  means that the topic needed purposeful documentation, and that's what we do at Defacto2.

<h2 class="mt-4">Milestones<small>, the Scene</small> </h2>
<p>
  The remainder of this page chronologically shows the early microcomputing milestones for the personal computer 
  industry and software piracy to offer insight into the birth of <a href="/thescene">the Scene</a> in the 
  earliest days of personal computing.
  The events are not definitive but are based on the digital artifacts collected. 
  In the early days of modern computing, the terms <em>micro</em>computer and personal computer were interchangeable, 
  but these computing appliances all evolved from the <em>mini</em>computers of the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
  The Scene most probably originated in the USA in 1979 or 1980 on the Apple II computer platform. 
  While well-known, it wasn't the best-selling machine of the early microcomputer generation. 
  However, the platform attracted classic hackers and curious personality types for various reasons.
  <a href="#the-early-underground">This era</a> was ground zero for influential computer game development, 
  <a href="#the-birth-of-warez">early copy protection, piracy</a> and online culture.
</p>
<p>
  The Scene concept spanned the Atlantic to Western Europe in 1983-84 to eventually thrive on the Commodore 64, 
  the world's all-time, highest-selling computer for decades. 
  North America and other markets also had their own booming Scene community on the Commodore, 
  but it's uncertain if they materialized independently before working in tandem.
</p>
<p>
  Late in the decade, UK and European game developers and sceners moved 
  onto the more powerful 16-bit computer platforms by Atari and Commodore. 
  Due to the emphasis on sound and graphics on both machines, 
  some in the European Scene pivoted to exclusively producing 
  digital artwork and multimedia, creating the <a href="https://www.demoscene.info"></a>.
</p>
<p>
  In the USA, where Atari and Commodore were based, their 16-bit computers failed in the local marketplace. 
  The failure and other poor decisions eventually finished both companies and their influence.
  North American consumers moved on to the business-oriented IBM PC platform, 
  later dominated by Intel and Microsoft with MS-DOS and Windows.
  And Apple was left as a niche player after it ditched its well-known II-series platform 
  to favor the novel Macintosh computer line.
</p>
<p>
  Due to its modular and fragmented design, the Intel / IBM PC wasn't the best gaming platform during the 1980s. 
  And apart from the popular adventure and flight simulator genres, 
  there were better choices for game development. 
  Instead, many North American gamers jumped to the Japanese video game console offerings by Nintendo and later Sega. 
</p>
<p>
  For the PC Scene, documentation for removing disk copy protection routines goes back to 1982, 
  with individuals releasing text files and posting messages on bulletin board systems. 
  However, there is little evidence of sceners cracking and releasing pirated software on the IBM PC before 1984, 
  and even then, it took until 1988-89 to gain momentum. 
  European sceners only reluctantly joined in on the PC in 1990, 
  with many avoiding the platform until years later after it became apparent 
  that software developers had moved on to the consoles, or Microsoft, and the Intel PC.
