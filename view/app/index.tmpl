  You're at the website conserving defunct software cracking, wares, and Warez Scene subcultures on obsolete Personal Computers. 
  The nature of historic software piracy, with high churn and elusiveness, meant the topic was once undocumented. 
  Defacto2 helps to solve this by hosting digital artifacts, including text files, demos, music, art, magazines, and other projects.

  <strong>The scene</strong> is often used to describe a modern online community. 
  Yet, this descriptor was probably lifted from the bohemian and counterculture <q>The Freak Scene</q> <a href="https://asklewis.substack.com/p/a-short-history-of-the-freak-scene">movement</a> of the 1960s.
  And reappropriated by journalists of the 1970s, who wrote about the groups of technically minded, misfit kids and adults whom the reporters dubbed <q>phone freaks</q>, aka <strong>phreaks</strong>, who ran hacks on the monopoly, Bell System, national telephone network.
  At the same time, <q>wares</q>, including soft+ware and hard+ware are used to describe goods.
  We can make a good case that <strong>the wares scene</strong> was probably coined by phreakers or the early pirates, 
  who shared the same online spaces but wanted to differentiate the scenes of exchanging information about the telephone network from the scene of <q>trading</q> computer wares.
  The spelling of <strong>warez</strong> with a z is newer. An Apple II user under the pseudonym Rabid Rasta <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/100/realpira.hum">complained</a> in mid-1984 about the alternative spells for wares 
  and their use by a new breed of kids getting online and spamming electronic message boards looking for free computer games.
</p>
<p>
  The remainder of this introduction chronologically shows the milestones for the microcomputer industry, the PC and software piracy to offer insight into the birth of that Scene.
  In the early days of modern computing, the terms <q>micro-computer</q> and <q>personal-computer</q> were interchangeable.
  Both referred to the desk-friendly computers that evolved from the unaffordable, refrigerator-sized business <q>mini-computers</q> of the 1970s.
  However, this site uses microcomputer to describe all the consumer computers incompatible with Microsoft DOS or Windows.
</p>
<p>
  On computers, the <strong>Scene</strong> most probably originated in the USA in 1979 or 1980 on the Apple II microcomputer platform, 
  with the catalyst being the popularity of the platform's new floppy disk drive, 
  the inclusion of disk copy-protection in software, the availability of usable modem software, 
  and the formation of early online messaging using computerized bulletin board systems.
  It was the genesis of a <a href="#the-early-underground">new era</a> for computer game development, 
  early copy protection, <a href="#the-birth-of-warez">piracy groups</a>, and online culture.
  While famous today, the range from Apple wasn't the best-selling of the early microcomputer generation. 
  But for some reason the expensive and influential system attracted both the classic hacker and the technology-curious.
</p>
<p>
  This period also saw the introduction of Atari's 400 and 800 microcomputers. 
  Atari was late in releasing its graphically superior line of machines, so it created several non-interactive demonstration software titles with music and animation intended to help sell the machines in-store. 
  To encourage development, Atari formed APX, the Atari Program Exchange, which allowed them to publish user-written software. 
  Some titles, such as 1981's Graphics/Sound Demonstration, include source code and instructions for various vanity programming effects to encourage new owners to develop on the machines and demonstrate their capabilities, much like a Demoscene that later evolved on Atari machines.
</p>
<p>
  The concept spanned the Atlantic to Western Europe in 1984-85 to eventually thrive on the Commodore 64,  
  the world's all-time, highest-selling computer for decades. 
  Small collectives of Commodore owners in Sweden, West Germany, and elsewhere would team up to import boxed software from the USA to digitally duplicate, occasionally crack, and repackage titles to share between friends and users. 
  Initially, this was due to the poor availability of retail software, but 
  even after the situation improved, many found the communities that formed around exchanging pirated software too compelling.
</p>
<p>
  Late in the 1980s, UK and European game developers and Sceners moved 
  onto the more powerful 16-bit computer platforms led by Atari and Commodore. 
  Due to the emphasis of sound and graphics on both machines, 
  some in the European Scene pivoted to exclusively producing 
  digital artwork and multimedia, creating the <a href="https://demozoo.org">Demoscene</a>.
  In the USA, where Atari and Commodore were based, their 16-bit computers failed in the local marketplace. 
  The failure and other poor decisions eventually finished both companies and their influence.
  While Apple Computer Inc. was left as a niche player after it ditched its popular Apple II platform to favor the novel and high value, Macintosh computer line.
</p>
<p>
  North American consumers moved on to the business-oriented IBM <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> platform, 
  later dominated by Intel and Microsoft with MS-<abbr title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr> and Windows.
  Due to its modular and fragmented design, the PC wasn't the best gaming platform during the 1980s and much of the 1990s. 
  And apart from the popular adventure and flight simulator genres in the 80s and the real-time strategy or Doom-clones of the 1990s, there were better choices for game development. 
  Instead, many American and Canadian gamers shifted to the Japanese video game console offerings by Nintendo, Sega and later Sony. 
</p>
<p>
  As for wares on PC, there is public information for removing disk copy protection going back to 1983, 
  when individuals in the USA released text files and posted messages to bulletin board systems.
  But so far, there is little evidence that people cracked or released pirated software on the IBM PC any earlier.
  The Scene on the PC took <abbr title="1988">five</abbr> or <abbr title="1989">six</abbr> years to gain momentum and led to an <a href="http://artscene.textfiles.com/artscene.html">Art Scene</a>  
  creating text art for use on the <q>elite</q> pirate and hacker bulletin board systems. 
  Eventually, like the Demoscene in Europe, the Art Scene artists broke away into a competitive community that produced <a href="https://16colo.rs">art for art's sake</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Some Nordic and Dutch individuals joined in on the PC in 1989, releasing both demonstrations and software cracks. 
  Others, including Germans, followed the subsequent year, with some going all in on the PC and others seeing it as a secondary system. 
  However, most Europeans avoided the platform for years, only reluctantly migrating to it after it became obvious that the software industry had moved from their favored microcomputers to the Japanese consoles and PCs.
  Yet this convergence of Europeans, North Americans, and other nationalities on a single, unified personal computer platform and, later, 
  the emerging home-access Internet began one of the first global online communities.
