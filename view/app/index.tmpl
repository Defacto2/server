    You're at the website conserving defunct software cracking, wares, and Warez Scene subcultures on obsolete Personal Computers. 
    The nature of historic software piracy, with high churn and elusiveness, meant the topic was once undocumented. 
    Defacto2 helps to solve this by hosting digital artifacts, including text files, demos, music, art, magazines, and other projects.

<h4 class="index-section-header">The Scene</h4>
<div class="index-intro-section">
  <a href="/thescene"><em>The Scene</em></a> is often used to describe a digital and online community. 
  But, this old descriptor was probably lifted from the bohemian and counterculture <q>The Freak Scene</q> <a href="https://asklewis.substack.com/p/a-short-history-of-the-freak-scene">movement</a> of the 1960s.
  And appropriated by <a href="https://archive.org/details/YIPLTAP_1-91/mode/2up">social activists</a> and journalists in the 1970s, who wrote about the groups of technically minded, misfit kids and young adults whom the writers dubbed <q><u>ph</u>one f<u>reaks</u></q>, aka <em>phreaks</em>, who ran hacks on Ma Bell.
The <a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/spotlight-judicial-history/breakup-ma-bell">monopoly</a> telephone network of the United States owned and operated by the Bell System, a century-old entity that at its peak was the largest company in the world.
  </p>
</div>
<h4 class="index-section-header">Wares</h4>
<div class="index-intro-section">
  At the same time, <em>ware</em>s, including soft<u>ware</u> and hard<u>ware</u> are used to describe goods.
  We can make a good case that the <em>wares scene</em> was probably coined by phreakers or the microcomputer enthusiasts, 
  who shared the same online spaces on early computer operated bulletin boards. 
  And needed to differentiate their posts, to split the phreak scene discussions of the phone network from those wanting computing goods or wares, who'd met up in person to swap hardware and software media.
</p>
<p>
  The spelling of <em>warez</em> with a z is newer. An Apple II user under the pseudonym Rabid Rasta <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/100/realpira.hum">complained</a> in mid-1984 about the alternative spells for wares 
  and their use by a new breed of kids getting online and spamming electronic message boards looking for free computer games.

  <div class="history-section-title">Apple II and the birth of cracking</div>
  <p>
    The <em>wares scene</em> as we know it today, originated in the USA, most likely in 1979 or 1980, on the Apple II microcomputer. 
  At this time, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/timeline/timeline_1950-2000.html">US copyright</a> did not apply to software usage, 
  and some industry publishers and authors were looking for ways to limit the copying and free exchange of the programs that they were creating to sell.
  The mid-1978 offering and <a href="https://collections.museumsvictoria.com.au/articles/2787">rapid popularity</a> of the Apple "Disk ][" floppy drive ecosystem, 
  combined with some experimentation, created the opportunity for the introduction of disk-copying restrictions into commercial software and games.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, a burgeoning new communications medium was being developed for posting and messaging on early computerized bulletin boards. These were home to computer enthusiasts who had an insatiable desire for new and novel software. And for many, an entitlement that digital goods were for the public domain, which stemmed from a long-held tradition in the computing space. Where hardware was purchased, but the software was given away. 
All combined, it probably led to a clash of cultures, capitalist vs freedom, and the birth of software <em>cracking</em> was the result. 
With the computer-savvy using trial-and-error to <em><a href="/image/milestone/cyber_strike_the_tornato.webp">unlock</a></em> the programs shipped on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/204747521812">floppies</a> containing disk copy-protections, and permit the duplication and swapping of software like it had always been.
This newfound knowledge was forever changing, so it got discussed, posted and repeated elsewhere to evolve into digital communities.
</p>
</div>
<div class="index-intro-section history-section">
  <div class="history-section-title">Atari and software demos</div>
  <p>
  This period also saw the delayed introduction of Atari's 400 and 800 microcomputers. 
  Atari felt it was late to the party in releasing its superior line of computers, so it created several non-interactive demonstration software titles with music and animation intended to help sell the machines in-store. 
  To encourage development, Atari formed APX, the Atari Program Exchange, which allowed the company to publish user-written software. 
  Some titles, such as 1981's Graphics/Sound Demonstration, include source code and instructions for various vanity programming effects. 
  To encourage new Atari owners to develop on the computers and demonstrate the system capabilities, much like a Demoscene that later evolved on the Atari machines.
</p>
</div>
<div class="index-intro-section history-section">
  <div class="history-section-title">Europe and the 16-bit microcomputers</div>
  <p>
  The concept of a Scene spanned the Atlantic to Western Europe in 1984-85 to eventually thrive on the Commodore 64,  
  the all-time, highest-selling microcomputer worldwide. 
  Small collectives of Commodore owners in Sweden, West Germany, and elsewhere would team up to import boxed software from the USA to digitally duplicate, occasionally crack, and repackage titles to share between friends and users. 
  Initially, this was due to the poor availability of microcomputer software in retail, but 
  even after the software distribution improved, many found the communities that formed around exchanging pirated software too compelling.
</p>
<p>
  Late in the 1980s, UK and European game developers and Sceners moved 
  onto the more powerful 16-bit computer platforms led by Atari and Commodore. 
  Due to the emphasis of sound and graphics on both machines, 
  some in the European Scene pivoted to exclusively producing 
  digital artwork and multimedia, creating the <a href="https://demozoo.org">Demoscene</a>.
  In the USA, where Atari and Commodore were based, their 16-bit computers failed in the local marketplace. 
  The failure and other poor decisions eventually finished both companies and their influence.
  While Apple Computer Inc. was left as a niche player after it ditched its popular Apple II platform to favor the novel and high value, Macintosh computer line.
</p>
<p>
  North American consumers moved on to the business-oriented IBM <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> platform, 
  later dominated by Intel and Microsoft with MS-<abbr title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr> and Windows.
  Due to its modular and fragmented design, the PC wasn't the best gaming platform during the 1980s and much of the 1990s. 
  And apart from the popular adventure and flight simulator genres in the 80s and the real-time strategy or Doom-clones of the 1990s, there were better choices for game development. 
  Instead, many American and Canadian gamers shifted to the Japanese video game console offerings by Nintendo, Sega and later Sony. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="index-intro-section history-section">
  <div class="history-section-title">IBM PC and the x86 platform</div>
  <p>
    Numerous text file instructions survive for modifying PC software and removing its disk copy protection schemes. 
  Instructions that once were commonplace on CompuServe and bulletin board posts that go back to 1983, possibly earlier.
  But unlike the Apple II crackers, these <em>unprotect</em> authors were not computing ideologues or kids seeking free games. 
  Instead, these copy-protection removal instructions were created for pricey business software, 
  purchased legitimately, and the cracks were frequently credited to real-life contacts. 
  As the copy protection found in early PC application software often seriously inconvenienced buyers, 
  especially businesses, where damaged or lost disk media could mean being locked out of critical software.
</p>
<p>
Separately, PC wares distributions did exist early in the IBM PC's lifecycle, at least in North America. Some bulletin boards offered a wide range of commercial and non-commercial PC software. However, they were uploaded as-is and usually without modification. End users of these dubious commercial downloads would presumably remove any copy protection using the freely available and legal unprotect instructions found on public message boards. How popular all this was is uncertain. Most application software from the 1980s is text-based and niche, with an unintuitive design. And really needed the printed manuals included in the retail product to get anything out of the software.
</p>
<p>
  We know that crackers and later pirate groups didn't start modifying and redistributing cracked IBM PC games until 1984,
  and it didn't pick up and evolve to a national distribution network until 1988 and 1989. 
  Oddly, after the software industry mostly abandoned copy protection on business-oriented software, 
  this became the most common form of pirated software found on the PC 'elite' file sharing boards. 
  Yet, these wares were frequently packaged and distributed anonymously and even contained detailed installation instructions, which their authors often left uncredited.
</p>
<p>
  The proliferation of bulletin boards running on IBM PCs and the sharing of all this software led to an <a href="http://artscene.textfiles.com/artscene.html">Art Scene</a>.
  Digital artists using PCs and primitive software competed to create text art for the elite pirate and hacker bulletin board systems.
  Eventually, like the Demoscene in Europe, the Art Scene artists broke away from piracy to form their own <a href="https://16colo.rs">community</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Outside the US and Canada, where the PC was often more expensive and perceived as a business tool, there was little engagement from Europe or elsewhere. 
  Some users from the <a href="/g/future-brain-inc">Netherlands</a> joined the PC Scene community in 1988, releasing demonstrations and software cracks. 
  Others from <a href="/g/norwegian-cracking-company">Norway</a>, Austria, 
  <a href="/g/coop">Germany</a>, <a href="/g/the-dream-team">Sweden</a>, 
  <a href="/g/sorcerers">Finland</a>, and <a href="/g/katharsis">Poland</a>, 
  came afterward, with some going all in on the platform but others seeing it as a secondary system.
</p>
<p>
However, many Europeans avoided the PC platform and moved over to the Japanese consoles. 
Others only reluctantly migrated to it after it became apparent that their favored systems from Commodore were dead-end platforms and that the software industry had long moved on.
</p>
<p>
Curiously, this has led to a mistaken mythologization of the Scene in Europe, with many people believing that the online culture, conventions, and vocabulary originated in Western Europe on Commodore and trickled over to North America and elsewhere. 
Yet, the Apple, Atari, and IBM PC existed well before the famed Commodore Amiga 500 and Commodore 64 microcomputers, and all these machines were designed and launched first in the United States.

<p>
  The remainder of this introductory page chronologically shows the milestones for the microcomputer industry, 
  the personal computer, software copyright and piracy, to offer historical insights into that Scene.
  In the early days of modern computing, the terms <q>micro-computer</q> and <q>personal-computer</q> were interchangeable.
  Both referred to the desk-friendly computers that evolved from the refrigerator-sized business <q>mini-computers</q> of the 1970s.
  However, this site uses <em>microcomputer</em> to describe all the consumer-computers that are incompatible with Microsoft DOS and Windows operating systems.
