  You're at the website preserving historic software cracking, wares, and Warez Scene subcultures on personal computers. 
  It is home to digital artifacts, including text files, demos, music, art, magazines, and other projects. 
  The nature of microcomputer software piracy, with high churn and elusiveness, 
  means that the topic needs purposeful documentation, and that's what is done at Defacto2.

  The remainder of this page chronologically shows the milestones for the microcomputer 
  industry and software piracy to offer insight into the birth of the Scene and personal computing.
  The events are not definitive but are based on the digital artifacts collected. 
  In the early days of modern computing, the terms microcomputer and personal computer were interchangeable. 
  Yet all these primative computing appliances evolved from the unaffordable and unwieldy business minicomputers of the 1970s.
</p>
<p>
  The Scene most probably originated in the USA in 1979 or 1980 on the Apple II computer platform, 
  with the catalyst being the popularity of the platform's new floppy disc drive, 
  the inclusion of disk copy-protection, the availability of modems and usable software, 
  and the formation of early online messaging using computerized bulletin board systems.
  It was the genesis of a <a href="#the-early-underground">new era</a> for influential computer game development, 
  early copy protection, <a href="#the-birth-of-warez">piracy groups</a>, and online culture.
  While famous today, the Apple wasn't the best-selling machine of the early microcomputer generation. 
  However, the system attracted classic hacker personalities and the technology-curious for diverse reasons.
</p>
<p>
  This period also saw the introduction of Atari's 400 and 800 microcomputers. 
  Atari was late in releasing its graphically superior line of machines, so it created several non-interactive demonstration software titles with music and animation intended to sell the machines in-store. 
  To encourage development, Atari formed APX, the Atari Program Exchange, which allowed Atari to publish user-written software. 
  Some titles, such as 1981's Graphics/Sound Demonstration, include source code and instructions for various programming effects to encourage new owners to use the machines and demonstrate their capabilities, much like a Demoscene that later evolved.
</p>
<p>
  The Scene concept spanned the Atlantic to Western Europe in 1984-85 to eventually thrive on the Commodore 64,  
  the world's all-time, highest-selling computer for decades. 
  Small collectives of Commodore owners in Sweden, West Germany, and elsewhere would team up to import boxed software from the USA to digitally duplicate, occasionally crack, and repackage titles to share between friends and users. 
  Initially, this was due to the poor availability of retail software. 
  However, the communities that formed around exchanging pirated software made the Scene too compelling for many, even after the retail situation improved. 
</p>
<p>
  Late in the 1980s, UK and European game developers and Sceners moved 
  onto the more powerful 16-bit computer platforms led by Atari and Commodore. 
  Due to the emphasis of sound and graphics on both machines, 
  some in the European Scene pivoted to exclusively producing 
  digital artwork and multimedia, creating the <a href="https://demozoo.org">Demoscene</a>.
  In the USA, where Atari and Commodore were based, their 16-bit computers failed in the local marketplace. 
  The failure and other poor decisions eventually finished both companies and their influence.
  While Apple was left as a niche player after it ditched its popular Apple II platform to favor the novel Macintosh computer line.

</p>
<p>
  North American consumers moved on to the business-oriented IBM <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> platform, 
  later dominated by Intel and Microsoft with <abbr title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr> and Windows.
  Due to its modular and fragmented design, the PC wasn't the best computer gaming platform during the 1980s and early 1990s. 
  And apart from the popular adventure and flight simulator genres, 
  there were better choices for game development. 
  Instead, many American and Canadian gamers shifted to the Japanese video game console offerings by Nintendo and later Sega and Sony. 
</p>
<p>
  For the PC Scene, documentation for removing disk copy protection routines goes back to 1982, when individuals released text files and posted messages on USA bulletin board systems.
  However, there is little evidence of people cracking and releasing pirated software on the IBM PC before 1983, 
  and even then, it took until 1988-89 to gain momentum.
  Around this time, an <a href="http://artscene.textfiles.com/artscene.html">Art Scene</a> emerged on the PC, 
  creating text art for use on the <q>elite</q> pirate and hacker bulletin board systems. 
  However, they later broke away into a competitive community that produced <a href="https://16colo.rs">art for art's sake</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The European Sceners only reluctantly joined the PC in and around 1990, 
  with most avoiding the platform until years later, and only after it became apparent 
  that the software industry had moved on to the Intel - Microsoft PC and video game consoles.
  Yet this convergence of Europeans, North Americans, and other nationalities on the same computer platform and, later, the emerging home-access Internet began one of the first global online communities.
