  You're at the website conserving defunct software cracking, wares, and Warez Scene subcultures on obsolete Personal Computers. 
  The nature of historic software piracy, with high churn and elusiveness, meant the topic was once undocumented. 
  Defacto2 helps to solve this by hosting digital artifacts, including text files, demos, music, art, magazines, and other projects.

  <strong>The scene</strong> is often used to describe a modern online community. 
  Yet, this descriptor was probably lifted from the bohemian and counterculture <q>The Freak Scene</q> <a href="https://asklewis.substack.com/p/a-short-history-of-the-freak-scene">movement</a> of the 1960s.
  And reappropriated by <a href="https://archive.org/details/YIPLTAP_1-91/mode/2up">social activists</a> and journalists in the 1970s, who wrote about the groups of technically minded, misfit kids and adults whom the writers dubbed <q>phone freaks</q>, aka <strong>phreaks</strong>, who ran hacks on the US Bell System, monopoly telephone network.
  At the same time, <q>wares</q>, including soft+ware and hard+ware are used to describe goods.
  We can make a good case that <strong>the wares scene</strong> was probably coined by phreakers or the early pirates, 
  who shared the same online spaces but wanted to differentiate the scenes of trading information on the telephone network from the scene of trading computer wares.
  The spelling of <strong>warez</strong> with a z is newer. An Apple II user under the pseudonym Rabid Rasta <a href="http://www.textfiles.com/100/realpira.hum">complained</a> in mid-1984 about the alternative spells for wares 
  and their use by a new breed of kids getting online and spamming electronic message boards looking for free computer games.
</p>
<p>
  The remainder of this introduction chronologically shows the milestones for the microcomputer industry, the PC and software piracy to offer insight into the birth of that Scene.
  In the early days of modern computing, the terms <q>micro-computer</q> and <q>personal-computer</q> were interchangeable.
  Both referred to the desk-friendly computers that evolved from the unaffordable, refrigerator-sized business <q>mini-computers</q> of the 1970s.
  However, this site uses microcomputer to describe all the consumer computers incompatible with Microsoft DOS or Windows.
</p>
<span class="lead">Apple II and Atari</span><br>
<p>
  On computers, the <strong>Scene</strong> most probably originated in the USA in 1979 or 1980 on the Apple II microcomputer platform, 
  with the catalyst being the popularity of the floppy disk drive, 
  the inclusion of disk copy-protection in software, the availability of usable modem software, 
  and the formation of early online messaging using computerized bulletin board systems.
  The timing was the genesis of a <a href="#the-early-underground">new era</a> for computer game development, 
  early copy protection, <a href="#the-birth-of-warez">piracy groups</a>, and online culture.
  While famous today, the II-series from Apple wasn't the best-selling of the early microcomputer generation. 
  However, the expensive system's design and marketing attracted classic hackers and technology-curious.
</p>
<p>
  This period also saw the introduction of Atari's 400 and 800 microcomputers. 
  Atari was late in releasing its graphically superior line of machines, so it created several non-interactive demonstration software titles with music and animation intended to help sell the machines in-store. 
  To encourage development, Atari formed APX, the Atari Program Exchange, which allowed them to publish user-written software. 
  Some titles, such as 1981's Graphics/Sound Demonstration, include source code and instructions for various vanity programming effects to encourage new owners to develop on the machines and demonstrate their capabilities, much like a Demoscene that later evolved on Atari machines.
</p>
<span class="lead">Europe and the 16-bits</span><br>
<p>
  The concept spanned the Atlantic to Western Europe in 1984-85 to eventually thrive on the Commodore 64,  
  the world's all-time, highest-selling computer for decades. 
  Small collectives of Commodore owners in Sweden, West Germany, and elsewhere would team up to import boxed software from the USA to digitally duplicate, occasionally crack, and repackage titles to share between friends and users. 
  Initially, this was due to the poor availability of retail software, but 
  even after the situation improved, many found the communities that formed around exchanging pirated software too compelling.
</p>
<p>
  Late in the 1980s, UK and European game developers and Sceners moved 
  onto the more powerful 16-bit computer platforms led by Atari and Commodore. 
  Due to the emphasis of sound and graphics on both machines, 
  some in the European Scene pivoted to exclusively producing 
  digital artwork and multimedia, creating the <a href="https://demozoo.org">Demoscene</a>.
  In the USA, where Atari and Commodore were based, their 16-bit computers failed in the local marketplace. 
  The failure and other poor decisions eventually finished both companies and their influence.
  While Apple Computer Inc. was left as a niche player after it ditched its popular Apple II platform to favor the novel and high value, Macintosh computer line.
</p>
<p>
  North American consumers moved on to the business-oriented IBM <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> platform, 
  later dominated by Intel and Microsoft with MS-<abbr title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr> and Windows.
  Due to its modular and fragmented design, the PC wasn't the best gaming platform during the 1980s and much of the 1990s. 
  And apart from the popular adventure and flight simulator genres in the 80s and the real-time strategy or Doom-clones of the 1990s, there were better choices for game development. 
  Instead, many American and Canadian gamers shifted to the Japanese video game console offerings by Nintendo, Sega and later Sony. 
</p>
<p>
  <span class="lead">IBM PC</span><br>
  Numerous textfile instructions exist for modifying PC software and removing disk copy protection schemes, such as the CompuServe and bulletin board posts that go back to 1983, possibly earlier.
  But unlike the Apple II pirates, the authors were not kids seeking free games. 
  Instead, these "Unprotect" instructions were created for pricey business software purchased legitimately and frequently credited to real-life contacts. 
  The copy protection found in early IBM PC software inconveniences users, especially for businesses where damaged or lost disk media leads to software lockout.
</p>
<p>
  Separately, PC wares distribution did exist early in the IBM PC's lifecycle, at least in North America, with bulletin boards offering legal and illicit software. 
  However, end users would presumably remove any copy protection in commercial software using freely available Unprotect instructions from open and public message boards.
</p>
<p>
  We know that individual crackers and later piracy groups didn't start modifying and distributing cracked IBM PC games until 1984 or 1985, and it didn't pick up nationally until 1988 and 1989. 
  Oddly, the more expensive, copy-protection-free business and system software was often the most common software found on many PC pirate boards. 
  Yet, these wares were frequently packaged and distributed anonymously and even contained detailed installation instructions, which their authors often left uncredited.
</p>
<p>
  The proliferation of bulletin boards running on IBM PCs and the sharing of all this software led to an <a href="http://artscene.textfiles.com/artscene.html">Art Scene</a>.
  Digital artists using PCs and primitive software competed to create text art for the elite pirate and hacker bulletin board systems.
  Eventually, like the Demoscene in Europe, the Art Scene artists broke away from piracy to form their own <a href="https://16colo.rs">community</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Outside the US and Canada, when the PC was often more expensive and perceived as a business tool, there was little engagement from Europe or elsewhere. 
  Some users from Norway and the Netherlands joined the PC Scene community in 1989, releasing demonstrations and software cracks. 
  Others from Germany, Sweden, Finland, Poland, and Denmark came afterward, with some going all in on the platform but others seeing it as a secondary system.
</p>
<p>
  However, many Europeans avoided the PC platform for years and only reluctantly migrated to it after it became apparent that their favored systems from Commodore were dead-end platforms and that the software industry had long moved on.
  Unfortunately, this has led to <en>a false mythologization</em> of the European Scene, with many people today believing Scene culture, its conventions, and vocabulary originated in Western Europe on Commodores and trickled down to North America and other microcomputers. 
  Yet, the Scene on PC and Ataris existed well before the famed, Commodore Amiga 500, and the Scene on the Apple II thrived long before the Commodore 64 microcomputer was ever popular.
