<h2 class="fs-3 fw-light mt-5">Mid 2025</h2>
<p>
  The mid-year sees another discovery of an extensive Scene releases backup, but captured from the late 90s. 
  And that has helped us <a href="/files/new-uploads">improve</a> the collection on our site.
</p>
<p>
So far, using these compact disc backups, we have been able to flesh out the major game groups of 1996, 
including the replacement of incomplete or broken text files. A common problem for releases that were butchered by third parties and shared online. 
However, until now, without these nearly 30-year-old original release archives, we were unable to verify or fix these problematic artifacts.
</p>
<p>
  Targeted top-tier game groups include, 
  <a href="/g/hybrid">Hybrid</a>, <a href="/g/prestige">Prestige</a>, 
  <a href="/g/paradigm">Paradigm</a>, <a href="/g/class">Class</a>,
  <a href="/g/razor-1911">Razor 1911</a> and a collection of FTP site ads. You can follow along using the <a href="/files/new-uploads">new uploads link</a>.
</p>
<p>
Also, a new <a href="/brokentexts">Broken text files</a> FAQ page has been added to the site. 
In it, we explain about the corrupt and incorrect texts and NFO files on the site. Why they exist and how they came about.
</p>
<h2 class="fs-3 fw-light mt-5">Early 2025</h2>
<p>
    The new year has continued to see new additions to the website.
    With the continued inclusion of scene files backed up on the HMS Bounty BBS tapes has been a significant focus, 
    and we are now up to the year of 1994. And these releases will probably continue on for a few more years.<br>
    These new discoveries has also meant some of the milestones listed on the <a href="/">home welcome</a> page have been revised
    and the page now also offers direct links to the highlights, such as <em><a href="/#:~:text=The%20first%20group">The first group</a></em>.
</p>
<p>
    There is a new <a href="/areacodes">BBS area codes page</a> for North America with a complete list of districts, as well as search and lookup features.
</p>
<p>
    On the backend, the site has expanded its support for more archive and compression types for hosted artifacts, including: 
    <code>.cab</code>, <code>.zst</code>, <code>.xz</code>, <code>.arj</code>, <code>.arc</code>, <code>.7z</code>.
</p>
<h2 class="fs-3 fw-light mt-5">Late 2024</h2>
<p>
    In the second half of 2024, we added thousands of new artifacts of historical importance to the scene to the website. 
    These include many new <a href="/files/how-to">Unprotect textfiles</a>, a couple intros [<a href="/f/ab22918">1</a>, 
    <a href="/f/ad27738">2</a>] from the early to late 1980s, 
    and <a href="/files/oldest">Scene releases</a> such as NFOs, trainers, and intros from 1988 to the early 1990s.
</p><p>
    The unprotected texts were anonymously submitted, thank you!
</p><p>
    The 1988+ files came from the dump of "<a href="/g/hms-bounty-bbs">The HMS Bounty</a>" BBS backup tapes, 
    which an individual* discovered in storage and painfully digitalized and assembled for online preservation.
    <br>* A massive thank you to you!
</p>

<p>In 2024, the website was <a href="https://github.com/Defacto2/server">rebuilt</a> from scratch using a new programming language and database platforms. 
    The <abbr title="original">OG</abbr> site, which operated for the past two decades, has been scrapped, but the files, images, and database records have remained untouched.</p>
<p>Given that some of the site's audience is nostalgic, and nostalgia often leads to resistance to change, some people may not like the new redesign. 
    Unfortunately, for those, change can be good, and this change is needed.</p>
<p>The scrapped code is in ColdFusion, a programming language from an defunct web server platform first developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia">Macromedia</a> in the 1990s. 
    It sat on top of Java, required a web server and a Java Servlet, it is very demanding of computing resources and costly to keep online. 
    The setup also needed a lot of unnecessary complexity compared with modern programming languages, meaning maintaining and adding features takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>Some features may be missing or broken due to the rewrite, and these will be worked on if necessary.</p>
<h2 class="lead">Navigation üòµ‚Äçüí´</h2>
<p>The other major issue with the OG site was the poor user interface design.
    Navigating is terrible, and discoverability could be better, primarily due to the mishmash of an icon-based navigation bar and hidden links within different pages.
    In this new design, the navigation bar links to all the site pages and always sits at the top of each page.</p>
<p>Also new is a page scrubber for a multipage collection of file artifacts, allowing users to jump to a different page quickly.</p>
<h2 class="lead">Groups</h2>
<p>The group listings have been reworked and are more practical. 
    By default, <a href="/releaser">releaser groups</a> are sorted to see the most prolific releasers in the collection. 
    There is also a page to list the groups <a href="/releaser/year">chronologically</a>, which should be a boon for history nerds. 
    Finally, individual group pages now display all the releases on <a href="/g/acid-productions">a single page</a> without the need for pagination.</p>
<h2 class="lead">Files</h2>
<p>The artifact file pages have been cleaned and speeded up and should load quickly. 
    The OG pages could become extremely busy and verbose. 
    Now, many of the features, like the DOS emulator, are <a href="/f/ad2a416">hidden behind buttons</a> that launch modals.</p>
<h2 class="lead">Search</h2>
<p>The search feature has been completely rewritten and simplified, as the OG search was again, far too busy. 
    Now, the search is broken into <a href="/search/releaser">Releaser name</a>, <a href="/search/file">Filename</a>, 
    or <a href="/search/desc">Title and description</a>, and the results are instantaneous.</p>
<h2 class="lead">Websites</h2>
<p class="mb-5">The collection of websites and links to the scene merchandise sold by various people has been cleaned up, simplified, and merged into <a href="/website/hide">a single page</a>.</p>
