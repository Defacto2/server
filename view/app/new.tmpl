<h1 class="lead">New in 2024</h1>
<p>In 2024, the website was rebuilt from scratch using a new programming language and database platforms. 
    The <abbr title="original">OG</abbr> site, which operated for the past two decades, has been scrapped, but the files, images, and database records have remained untouched.</p>
<p>Given that some of the site's audience is nostalgic, and nostalgia often leads to resistance to change, some people may not like the new redesign. 
    Unfortunately, for those, change can be good, and this change is needed.</p>
<p>The scrapped code is in ColdFusion, a programming language from an defunct web server platform first developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia">Macromedia</a> in the 1990s. 
    It sat on top of Java, required a web server and a Java Servlet, it is very demanding of computing resources and costly to keep online. 
    The setup also needed a lot of unnecessary complexity compared with modern programming languages, meaning maintaining and adding features takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>Some features may be missing or broken due to the rewrite, and these will be worked on if necessary.</p>
<h1 class="lead">Navigation üòµ‚Äçüí´</h1>
<p>The other major issue with the OG site was the poor user interface design.
    Navigating is terrible, and discoverability could be better, primarily due to the mishmash of an icon-based navigation bar and hidden links within different pages.
    In this new design, the navigation bar links to all the site pages and always sits at the top of each page.</p>
<p>Also new is a page scrubber for a multipage collection of file artifacts, allowing users to jump to a different page quickly.</p>
<h1 class="lead">Groups</h1>
<p>The group listings have been reworked and are more practical. 
    By default, <a href="/releaser">releaser groups</a> are sorted to see the most prolific releasers in the collection. 
    There is also a page to list the groups <a href="/releaser/year">chronologically</a>, which should be a boon for history nerds. 
    Finally, individual group pages now display all the releases on <a href="/g/acid-productions">a single page</a> without the need for pagination.</p>
<h1 class="lead">Files</h1>
<p>The artifact file pages have been cleaned and speeded up and should load quickly. 
    The OG pages could become extremely busy and verbose. 
    Now, many of the features, like the DOS emulator, are <a href="/f/ad2a416">hidden behind buttons</a> that launch modals.</p>
<h1 class="lead">Search</h1>
<p>The search feature has been completely rewritten and simplified, as the OG search was again, far too busy. 
    Now, the search is broken into <a href="/search/releaser">Releaser name</a>, <a href="/search/file">Filename</a>, 
    or <a href="/search/desc">Title and description</a>, and the results are instantaneous.</p>
<h1 class="lead">Websites</h1>
<p class="mb-5">The collection of websites and links to the scene merchandise sold by various people has been cleaned up, simplified, and merged into <a href="/website/hide">a single page</a>.</p>
