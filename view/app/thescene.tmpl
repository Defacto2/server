    With its origins going back to the late 1970s, The Scene comes from an era when access to the Internet 
    was restricted and the other major computer networks were inaccessible to the general public.  
    Instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board Systems</a> hosted on personal computers housed in
    people's homes and connected to the copper voice-telephone network took on this online role for many savvy, early computer owners. 
    Running specialized software and hardware, these boards enabled like-minded people to use their home computers to 
    connect, communicate, and later exchange digital files.

        Cracking is the craft of modifying software for a particular purpose.
        It can vary widely from the simple act of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainer_(games)">creating cheats for games</a> (trainers) 
        to the removal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection">sophisticated software copy protection</a>.
        The sharing of commercial software, often accompanied by the removal of copy protection, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez">is defined as <strong>warez</strong></a>. 
        But software cracking and warez were not always the same, or even illegal.
        <br>
        Until December 1980, authors in the US could not use copyright to restrict program usage on a computer, as software got defined as a literary work like a book.
        Even after the missing law was rectified, it was uncertain if the copyright controls applied to the author's source code or also to the compiled program. 
        However, other than the existing counterfeit and trademark laws, there were few legal restrictions on the use or modification of the software after it was in the hands of a customer.
        <br>
        This situation changed in the late 1990s and 2000s with the rise of the Internet, 
        entertainment media moving to digital formats, and excessive lobbying by the US entertainment and media industries.
        After which, one could argue with today's "copyright&nbsp;trolls", the law overcorrected, 
        giving rights holders excessive legal power over media at the expense of customers and public fair use.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">Hacking</a> 
        is the manipulation or exploration of most things computer-related, often online. 
        But hacking is not to be confused with software cracking, theft, or ransomware. 
        Originally, hacking had a more benign and innocent purpose of experimentation. 
        Unfortunately, nowadays, with the involvement of nation-state bad actors and organized crime, hacking is often associated with digital privateering.

        Today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreaking">phone phreaking</a> is redundant, 
        but it was once a popular method of exploiting the landline telephone networks to make free phone calls back when these were often billed by the minute and pricey. 
        <br>
        Phreaking was criminal but still popular with risk-taking computer users who were willing to use their home address to 
        connect gratis to remote boards located outside of their local metropolitan area, as well as boards based interstate and overseas.
        <br>
        Phreaking also allowed for "party lines". These were gratis group voice chats with people from around the world, 
        but long before they became commonplace with broadband internet.
