<div class="lead"><small>Historically, <q>The Scene</q> consisted of communities of computer users engaged in particular activities but often loosely grouped.</small></div>
<div>
    With online origins going back to the 1980s, The Scene comes from an era when the Internet and other major networks were inaccessible to the general public. 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">Bulletin Board Systems</a> were the principal means for savvy computer users to connect online, communicate and exchange data. 
    To encourage more people to use their services, boards often hosted various computer-specific activities and subjects. 
    It led to online communities engaged in some intertwined topics that evolved, were grouped, and became the Scene.

        Cracking is the craft of modifying software for a particular purpose.
        It can vary widely from the simple act of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainer_(games)">creating cheats for video games</a> (trainers) 
        to the removal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection">sophisticated software copy protection</a>.
        The sharing of software with its copy-protection removed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez">gets defined as <strong>warez</strong></a>. 
        In the first couple of decades of microcomputing, the removal of copy protection through cracking software was not criminal. 
        However, this has long since changed; cracking, the sharing of commercial software and entertainment media are all crimes.

    <dd class="col-sm-9">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">Hacking</a> is the unorthodox manipulation or exploration of most things computer-related, often online, but it should not be confused with software cracking.
        Online texts and tools for hacking were often combined with those on phreaking, anarchy, and computer virus creation, using the h/p/a/v classification.
        Today this grouping has fallen out of favor, especially the modern association of <a href="http://textfiles.com/anarchy/">anarchy text files</a> and <a href="http://textfiles.com/virus/">computer viruses</a> that get misconstrued for activities against nation-states.
