<p class="lead">Shrinker.err Dispatcher initialization errors</p>
<p>
An ancient Windows program crashes with the cryptic error message.
</p>
<p>
This is a common error that occurs with Windows 9x applications that are compressed with earlier versions of the Shrinker compression library. 
Fortunately, there is an easy solution with decompressing the application using either DeShrink 1.6 or UnShrinker. 
DeShrink is a standard Windows application, while UnShrinker uses the command prompt.
</p>
<p>
There will be occasions where these solutions cannot decrypt or fix the affected programs. 
In these circumstances, you will not be able to solve this issue other than to run the applications generating the Dispatcher error on a Windows 95, 98, or ME system.

<p class="lead">Runtime error 200</p>
<p>
An ancient DOS program crashed with the cryptic error message.
</p>
<p>
A runtime error 200 message usually occurs with old DOS applications written in Turbo and Borland Pascal. 
Turbo Pascal had a timing bug that caused its compiled programs to crash when they were executed on machines running at 200 MHz or faster. 
It is known as the <q>CRT unit issue</q> and can be fixed by applying a patch to the affected application. 
Otherwise, you can run the application in DOSBox, which can artificially slow down the speed of the emulated DOS session.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to patch the application we have created a guide to help you through it using the Windows Command Prompt.

    In our example, we are going to patch <code>defacto.exe</code>, which is the binary from an early Defacto magazine that suffers from this bug.

<p class="lead">This program caused an invalid page fault in module</p>
<p>
The invalid page fault alert is a cryptic error caused by programs compiled for Windows 95 and 98 attempting to access restricted random-access memory. 
This is commonly an emulation and virtualization error, and often, the only solution is to run the program on real PC hardware.
Or the program might be corrupt due to antiquated antivirus removal.
