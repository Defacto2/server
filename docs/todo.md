# TODOs and tasks

### Ideas or doubleful tasks

### Recommendations

- [ ] Use DigitalOcean API to display Estimated Droplet Transfer Pool usage and remaining balance. 
		https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/digitalocean/godo https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#operation/droplets_get
- [ ] After a successful demozoo/pouet upload, defer a sync for the data to the artifact record.
- [ ] Find all msdos apps that use incompatible archives such as ARJ, ARC.
- [ ] jsdos not working for extras using lha/lzh extension, see: http://localhost:1323/f/b428607
- [ ] add download link for repacked archives contained in extras.
