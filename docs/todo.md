#### Support Unicode slug URLs as currently the regex removes all non alphanumeric chars.

```go
/*
Error:      	Not equal:
            	expected: "Moo√±people"
            	actual  : "Moopeople"

				use utf8 lib to detect extended chars?
*/
```

### URL /v/xxx pattern tests.

- [X] detect if the file contains /r/n or /n and replace with /n only.
		example, http://localhost:1323/v/af18f9b

        example, http://localhost:1323/v/b01de5b 
		         http://localhost:1323/v/b521c83
