     |          PRESS is a replacement for the DOS pause command.         |
     |  By default it darkens the screen and displays an OKAY button box. |
     |                                                                    |
     |     Press a key, the box disappears and your screen colors are     |
     |    restored.  PRESS can do much more than this simple function.    |
     |          See the list of options below for more information.       |
     |                                                                    |
     |                       +--------+   +--------+                      |
     |                       |  Okay  |   | Cancel |                      |
     |                       +--------+   +--------+                      |

PRESS can display up to 18 lines of text you enter on the command line.
PRESS can display up to 19 lines of text from a file you specify.
Text is displayed in the press box with an okay or okay/cancel button and
set errorlevel so your batch files can make decisions based on user
response.  Try the sample.bat sample batch file.

Usage:  PRESS [-l "text"] [-l "text" ... ]
              [-s <text_color>]
              [-b <background_color>]
              [-e <box_type>]       ; SINGLE, DOUBLE, NONE, NARROW
              [-f <box_foreground>]
              [-t <timeout_seconds>]
              [-w width]
              [ -c -z -d -g -m -n -x -r ]
              [ -i <filename> ]

              All options are optional....

              ? - display helpscreen.

              -c toggle color.
              -z Add "Cancel" button.
              -d do not shadow screen.
              -g flashes the screen.
              -m do not try and use the mouse.
                    Some pc's take too long to check for the mouse driver
                    which causes a long delay before the press box appears.
                    Use this function to eliminate the delay and use of
                    the mouse to terminate the press box.
              -n beeps.
              -x non-exploding press box.
              -r reboot computer on termination.

Up to 19 lines of text (each line less than 75 characters) may be specifed
if stored in an ascii file and specified with the -i option.

PRESS sets the ERRORLEVEL to 0 if:
   -z is NOT used:
      Any key other than ESC is pressed.
   -z is used:
      RTN is pressed while the Okay button is active.

PRESS sets the ERRORLEVEL to 5 if:
   -z is NOT used:
      ESC is pressed.
   -z is used:
      RTN is pressed while the Cancel button is active.

Note:  'O' and ALT-O are the same as selecting OKAY.
       'C' and ALT-C is the same as selecting CANCEL (if -z is used).


PRESS is an example program using functions called z_question(), z_flash(),
z_shadow_screen() and z_reboot() in my C programming library.  The command
line options are passed to the functions at run time.  The ZLIB C library
will be released someday for others to use.  Interested parties should
contact the author.
