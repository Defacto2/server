PRESS is a replacement for the DOS pause command.
By default it darkens the screen and displays an OKAY button box.

Press a key, the box disappears and your screen colors are
restored.  PRESS can do much more than this simple function.
See the list of options in press.doc for more information or
view the press helpscreen by using the -h command line option.
