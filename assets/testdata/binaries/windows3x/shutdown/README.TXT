ShutDown Screen
---------------
To view this file in Notepad, MAXIMIZE the window.

This is a simple bitmap which has been converted into an executeable. 
It looks just like the standard Windows 95 shutdown screen.

Getting Started
---------------
Put the file SHUTDOWN.EXE into a location on your path or in the root 
directory. If Windows is automatically run from autoexec.bat, append 
the following line AFTER "Win" or "Win.Exe"

SHUTDOWN.EXE

After Windows is ran and exits, the picture will display.

Customisation
-------------
If you want a bitmap converted in to an .EXE contact me at 
singedland@crosswinds.net and I'll get the file from you and have it
converted as soon as possible. 

BTW, No charge
