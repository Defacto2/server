Calmira is the new free version of Calypso that pushes
16-bit technology to the limit to bring you the ultimate
interface to Windows 3.

o  Icon based file manager with free floating windows
o  Support for 4DOS file descriptions (in place of long filenames)
o  Desktop and file based shortcuts to any object
o  Explorer tree that lets you navigate faster through disks
o  Taskbar with versatile "Start" menu, nested to any level
o  Wastepaper bin to store deleted files and folders
o  Sophisticated -- the slickest front end this side of Windows 95
o  Fast -- works well even on humble 386 and 486 hardware
o  Flexible -- hundreds of easily accessible options and settings


Installation instructions are contained in the help file.
To dive straight in, unzip the main ZIP file you received into a
directory on your hard disk, and run CALMIRA.EXE.


Source code
-----------

Full source is supplied in SOURCE.ZIP.  Make sure you re-create the
stored directories when extracting the files (if you are using
PKUNZIP, use the -d switch).

Read the file DEVNOTES.TXT for more details on re-compiling the
program.  You will need Borland Delphi 1.0 or equivalent.

It's unlikely that I will have time to develop the program further,
which is why the source is provided -- if you would like to maintain
your own variant of Calmira, you are most welcome to do so.
