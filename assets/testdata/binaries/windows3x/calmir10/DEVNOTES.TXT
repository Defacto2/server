D E V E L O P E R ' S   N O T E S
=================================

Calmira was created using Borland Delphi for Windows 3.1.  This
package contains the source files and resources needed to recompile
the program.


Source files
============

Full source is supplied in SOURCE.ZIP.  Make sure you re-create the
stored directories when extracting the files -- if you are using
PKUNZIP, add the -d switch.

Four subdirectories will be created for you:

SRC    the main program covered by the license
VCL    public domain components
UTILS  public domain libraries
HELP   text and graphics to build the help file

Adjust the search path in all the DPR files (Options|Project) to
reflect your chosen directory structure.  The other project settings
should be left alone.

All 4 project files should be compiled before attempting to run.


Re-deploying
============

If you wish to release modified versions of Calmira, make sure that
you read the GNU General Public License in the file LICENSE.TXT that
is supplied with the binary files.  (The public domain material may,
of course, be used with no restrictions).

Please do not use the filenames calmirXX.zip for uploading, since
these might be used to distribute updated versions of the original
source.  You can your name derivative program anything you like
for public distribution, so long as you follow the terms in the
license.


Components
==========

You can compile a working copy of Calmira without installing the
components, but you must install them in order to open the forms.
These components are supplied:
