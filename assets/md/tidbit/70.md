According to a 2008 High Society [history page](https://www.high-society.at/history.php), the group name came about in 1996. However the team were previously known as The Future Boys, who were founded in Austria on the Commodore 64 way back in 1986. Some members of the group later released on the Commodore Amiga as the Home Boys after the Commodore 64 as a viable platform faded from relevance. The Future Boys brand returned in 1995 but moved away from its microcomputer roots and instead released console software for the SNES. It was this entity that renamed itself in 1996 to High Society, and the following year exclusively focused on the PC and consoles such as the N64 and PlayStation.

The same website mentions that put together, the members have programmed on a huge variety of platforms including the Commodore 16, 64, Amiga; NeoGeo; NES, SNES Gameboy, N64; PC Engine; PlayStation; Dreamcast; PC and cellular phones (pre-iOS/Android).
