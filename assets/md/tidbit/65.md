While founded in 1985 in North America, by 1990, Red Sector were mostly a European cracking and demo group releasing both on the Commodore 64 and Amiga. Their 1990 entry onto the PC was solely wares related, but they [lacked an experienced PC cracker](/f/b01d2f2) and would team with existing groups to supply titles and have them crack and release under a cooperation. This collaboration was mostly done with Public Enemy from Canada.

Over in Europe, Red Sector and the German group Tristar decided to merge mid-year forming the famous Tristar & Red Sector Inc. or TRSi. However, this new branding wasn't reflected on the PC until months later in December with a comical collaboration of five groups and the release of [4D Sports Driving presented by](/f/a74ac6) "Public Enemy / TRSi / Defjam / The Dream Team".
