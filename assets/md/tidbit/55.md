The Sysops Association Network was collective of elite BBS sysops that exchanged information and forums on the latest bulletin board news and technical goings. The organisation at some stages grew quite large until the Internet abruptly made it and the member boards redundant. At times TSAN claimed it was founded in 1984, but whether this was a single BBS or an actual organisation is unknown.
